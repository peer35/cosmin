Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: During the past decade, common mental disorders (CMD) have emerged as a major public and occupational health problem in many countries. Several instruments have been developed to measure the influence of health on functioning at work. To select appropriate instruments for use in occupational health practice and research, the measurement properties (eg, reliability, validity, responsiveness) must be evaluated. The objective of this study is to appraise critically and compare the measurement properties of self-reported health-related work-functioning instruments among workers with CMD. METHODS: A systematic review was performed searching three electronic databases. Papers were included that: (i) mainly focused on the development and/or evaluation of the measurement properties of a self-reported health-related work-functioning instrument; (ii) were conducted in a CMD population; and (iii) were fulltext original papers. Quality appraisal was performed using the consensus-based standards for the selection of health status measurement instruments (COSMIN) checklist. RESULTS: Five papers evaluating measurement properties of five self-reported health-related work-functioning instruments in CMD populations were included. There is little evidence available for the measurement properties of the identified instruments in this population, mainly due to low methodological quality of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence on measurement properties is based on studies of poor-to-fair methodological quality. Information on a number of measurement properties, such as measurement error, content validity, and cross-cultural validity is still lacking. Therefore, no evidence-based decisions and recommendations can be made for the use of health-related work functioning instruments.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric condition with many adverse outcomes in elderly populations including death. Despite this, it is often misdiagnosed and mistreated. A number of scales can be used to detect delirium. We review scales that have been used in delirium studies and report their psychometric properties. METHOD: An extensive MEDLINE database search and subsequent examination of reference lists was conducted to identify the various delirium scales that have been designed, primarily for use in the elderly. RESULTS: Twenty-four scales were identified. Delirium instruments differed according to the classification system they were based on, length of time to administer, the rater and whether they were screening scales or measured symptom severity. The psychometric properties of each scale is reported. CONCLUSION: A large number of scales exist, but not all are properly evaluated in terms of psychometric properties, and there is not unanimity about which scale is the best.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: Cancer and its treatment produce multiple symptoms that significantly distress patients and impair function. Effective symptom management requires effective symptom assessment. A variety of measurement instruments have been created to identify symptoms in oncology practice. Here we review symptom assessment measures available for gynecologic cancers. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify articles on symptom assessment and quality-of-life instruments in gynecologic oncology. Articles were accessed through searches performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, and the Cochrane Library. Studies were selected if they described development of symptom assessment tools for diagnosis and measurement of symptoms of gynecologic cancers and treatments. We also included studies using quality-of-life measurement tools that contained symptom items. RESULTS: Nine studies examined symptom assessment, quality-of-life assessment, or symptom indexes for various gynecologic cancers. Studies varied in design, patient profiles, symptoms assessed, and outcomes measured. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in the studies. CONCLUSION: Although pain is well-studied and well-characterized, other disease-specific and general systemic symptoms of gynecologic cancers need better understanding and assessment. Accordingly, assessment of symptoms throughout the course of disease is crucial for treatment decisions and outcomes monitoring for patients with gynecologic cancer. This is especially true for survivors of gynecologic cancer, for patients whose treatment was unsuccessful, or for choosing between treatments with comparable survival outcomes. However, measurement and assessment of cancer-related symptoms is challenging because of the complex interaction between disease progression, multi-modality treatments, and symptoms. In this review, we evaluate the currently available symptom assessment tools for gynecologic cancers, along with quality-of-life assessment tools that include symptom items, and we give recommendations for further research.], accnum: %q[20688364], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Agarwal, S.", "Bodurka, D.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of tiredness or exhaustion that occurs in 70-100% of cancer patients. The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of the quality of research performed on existing CRF self-report questionnaires and compare their reported psychometric properties and user-friendliness. METHODS: Database searches of CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, PEDro, and PsycINFO were undertaken to find published scales. Standardized criteria were used to assess quality and user-friendliness. RESULTS: Thirty-five articles were included that described 18 questionnaires-seven one-dimensional questionnaires and 11 multidimensional questionnaires. The mean item count was 20.8 (range: 3-83). The mean overall score of the one-dimensional questionnaires was 10.4 of a maximum of 18 points (range: 7.6-14.3). The mean overall score of the multidimensional questionnaires was 9.4 of a maximum of 18 points (range: 4.3-14.4). CONCLUSION: Recommendations were made for the selection of a scale.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: Assessing the outcomes of patients following surgical interventions is a challenging task. Traditionally the end results of joint replacement were based on morbidity/mortality rates and operative complications. The modern approach to outcomes following Orthopaedic surgery has shifted from the success or failure of implants towards patient satisfaction and the quality of life achieved. The aim of this paper was to identify and analyse the common scoring systems present in the medical literature for evaluating outcomes after hip interventions. METHODS: A pub-med search was performed using terms 'scoring system, functional outcomes, hip joint'. Specific limitations and exclusion criteria were used and the reference lists of the articles included in the study were subjected to further analysis for identification of additional relevant papers. RESULTS: 293 articles were identified of which 40 met the inclusion criteria. The outcome measures were divided into: (i) hip specific outcomes, (ii) disease-specific measures and (iii) generic quality of life measures. Based on our analysis, we would recommend a combination of the hip specific Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and the disease specific WOMAC score. The OHS is quick and easy to complete, has a very high response rate and is free from clinician bias. On the other hand, the majority of hip pathology is related to degenerative disease, thus making the WOMAC the most appropriate measure to use. Where comparison between different conditions is required, then an additional generic quality of life (QOL) score, such as EQ5D, that can enable comparisons in cost-effectiveness term can be used. CONCLUSION: The ideal outcome measure should be one that is specific for the hip joint, possesses a generic component and takes into consideration co-morbidities and the use of walking aids. Although many validated generic measures exist, additional validation studies, including the OHS, are desirable to evaluate all the hip specific measures of outcome.], accnum: %q[21163481], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Ahmad, M.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Purpose: In this literature review we evaluated the feasibility and clinimetric quality of quality-of-life (QoL) measurement instruments suitable for use in palliative care. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify instruments measuring (at least one domain of) QoL. We selected articles that present data on patients receiving palliative care and at least one measurement property. A checklist was used to describe the characteristics of the instruments, and a widely accepted rating list was used to evaluate the clinimetric aspects. Results: 29 instruments were identified and evaluated, most of which were targeted at palliative patients in general. None of the instruments demonstrated satisfactory results for all measurement properties. Fourteen instruments received positive ratings for construct validity. Thirteen instruments were tested for reliability, but only two were tested adequately and had positive results (ICC>0.70). Responsiveness was not tested adequately for any of the instruments. Very few of the studies provided information on the interpretation of the scores. Overall, the MQOL, followed by the QUAL-E and the QODD, received the best ratings for their measurement properties.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Considerable evidence has accumulated on the association between pregnancy-specific stress and adverse birth outcomes with an increasing number of measures of pregnancy-specific stress being developed internationally. However, the introduction of these measures has not always been theoretically or psychometrically grounded, resulting in questions about the quality and direction of such research. This review summarizes evidence on the reliability and validity of pregnancy-specific stress measures identified between 1980 and October 2010. Fifteen pregnancy-specific stress measures were identified. Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranged from 0.51-0.96 and predictive validity data on preterm birth were reported for five measures. Convergent validity data suggest that pregnancy-specific stress is related to, but distinct from, global stress. Findings from this review consolidate current knowledge on pregnancy-specific stress as a consistent predictor of premature birth. This review also advances awareness of the range of measures of pregnancy-specific stress and documents their strengths and limitations based on published reliability and validity data. Careful consideration needs to be given as to which measures to use in future research to maximize the development of stress theory in pregnancy and appropriate interventions for women who experience stress in pregnancy.

METHODS: A search of PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Registry, SCOPUS and PEDro databases up to December 2009 identified the validation studies. The quality of the measurement properties were assessed based on the Terwee and Bot criteria, and Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medical Outcomes Trust guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 68 studies examining 28 instruments were identified. Three instruments had positive ratings for content validity. None of the instruments satisfied both factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha criteria for internal consistency. Four measures were positively-rated for agreement. Nine tools had positive ratings for construct validity. Twenty-four of the instruments had indeterminate ratings for responsiveness to clinical change. Only certain subscales of 2 instruments were positively-rated for responsiveness to clinical change. CONCLUSION: A wide variety of multidimensional patient-reported instruments has been used to assess rehabilitation outcomes after hip and knee arthroplasty, but information about their measurement attributes in these populations is inadequate.

RESULTS: The 4 measures that fit the prespecified inclusion criteria were the Modified Barthel Index (MBI), the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the Quadriplegia Index of Function (QIF), and the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM). The MBI and the QIF were found to have minimal evidence for validity, whereas the FIM and the SCIM were found to be reliable and valid. The MBI has little clinical utility for use in the SCI population. Likewise, the FIM applies mainly when measuring burden of care, which is not necessarily a reflection of functional recovery. The QIF is useful for measuring functional recovery but only in a subpopulation of people with SCI, and substantial validity data are still required. The SCIM is the only functional recovery outcome measure designed specifically for SCI. CONCLUSIONS: The multinational work group recommends that the latest version of the SCIM (SCIM III) continue to be refined and validated and subsequently implemented worldwide as the primary functional recovery outcome measure for SCI. The QIF may continue to be developed and validated for use as a supplemental tool for the nonambulatory tetraplegic population.], accnum: %q[18581660], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Anderson, K.", "Aito, S.", "Atkins, M.", "Biering-Sorensen, F.", "Charlifue, S.", "Curt, A.", "Ditunno, J.", "Glass, C.", "Marino, R.", "Marshall, R.", "Mulcahey, M.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Sport and active recreation injuries are common. Participants are generally young, healthy and physically active individuals and as a result their injuries can have long-ranging effects for both the individuals and society. Accurate and appropriate measurement of the outcomes of sport and active recreation injuries is essential for understanding the time frame and quality of recovery, and quantifying the burden of these injuries. The WHO has developed a framework that can be used for studying health-related outcomes called the International Classification of Function (ICF). As such, the ICF is a useful tool for assessing the suitability of outcome measures for general sport and active recreation populations. This article provides a review of outcome measures that are potentially suitable for use in a general sport and active recreation injury population, assessed within the framework of the ICF. An extensive literature search was performed to identify instruments used in sport and active recreation (and general) injury populations that would be suitable for measuring the outcomes and burden of sport and recreation injuries and return to physical activity. The search identified six health status and health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL) measures and five functional outcome measures. Of the outcome measures reviewed, the Short Form-36 was the most commonly used and covered many of the areas relevant to a sport and active recreation population. The comprehensiveness of the Sickness Impact Profile-36 meant that it contained many relevant items; however, its usefulness is limited by its high level of responder burden. The Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment provided a detailed measure of function, appropriate to a sport and active recreation population, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended can provide a suitable global measure of function. The Short International Physical Activity Questionnaire is a potential means of measuring return to physical activity for this group. There are no outcome measures specifically designed to measure outcomes in a general sport and active recreation population. There are, however, existing measures that when used in combination have the potential to provide a comprehensive assessment of injury outcomes in this group. Future research should focus on validating existing measures suitable for a sport and active recreation population as well as developing an ICF sport and active recreation core set of items. An ICF core set would assist researchers and clinicians in selecting the combination of outcome measures most appropriate to their needs as well forming the basis for the development of a specific sport and active recreation outcome measure.], accnum: %q[20092366], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)"], author: ["Andrew, N.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Wearing-off occurs in the majority of patients with Parkinson's disease after a few years of dopaminergic therapy. Because a variety of scales have been used to estimate wearing-off, the Movement Disorder Society commissioned a task force to assess their clinimetric properties. A systematic review was conducted to identify wearing-off scales that have either been validated or used in Parkinson's patients. A scale was designated "Recommended" if it had been used in clinical studies beyond the group that developed it, if it had been specifically used in Parkinson's disease reports, and if clinimetric studies had established that it is valid, reliable, and sensitive. "Suggested" scales met 2 of the above criteria, and those meeting 1 were "Listed." We identified 3 diagnostic and 4 severity rating scales for wearing-off quantification. Two questionnaires met the criteria to be Recommended for diagnostic screening (questionnaires for 19 and 9 items), and 1 was Suggested (questionnaire for 32 items). Only the patient diaries were Recommended to assess wearing-off severity, with the caveat of relatively limited knowledge of validity.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Measuring quality of life (QoL) has become an increasingly important dimension of assessing patient well-being and drug efficacy. As there are now several asthma QoL questionnaires to choose from, it is important to appreciate their strengths and weaknesses. To assist in this choice, we have reviewed the existing questionnaires in a structured way. Information relating to the conceptual and measurement model, reliability, validity, interpretability, burden, administration format and translations was extracted from the published literature. The instruments differ in almost all criteria considered, and therefore it cannot be assumed that they measure the same thing. We recommend the selection of questionnaires that are designed only for asthma and that do not assess symptoms as part of QoL. Only two of the questionnaires reviewed fulfill these requirements: the Sydney Asthma QoL Questionnaire (AQLQ-S) and the Living with Asthma Questionnaire (LWAQ). However, for multinational studies, it may be convenient or practical to use questionnaires that have been linguistically validated in many languages (AQLQ-J, SGRQ).

Record.create(abstract: %q[CONTEXT: Sex is important to quality of life. There are a number of questionnaires to measure sexual-function, but many lack applicability and usefulness to certain groups. OBJECTIVE: To identify questionnaires measuring sexual function, determine the domains most commonly assessed, and examine evidence for their usefulness in different populations. DATA SOURCES: Computerized literature search using Medline, PubMed and PsychLit, reference lists, and unpublished reports, published in English between 1957 and 2001. MESH terms included sexual function, sexual dysfunction, sexual satisfaction, quality of life, and questionnaire. Articles were excluded if the questionnaire did not measure sexual function from the patient perspective. DATA EXTRACTION: Questionnaires were grouped as general questionnaires that include a sexual function domain, and sexual-function-specific questionnaires. Questionnaires were evaluated for domains, applicability to different populations, and evidence for reliability, validity and responsiveness. DATA SYNTHESIS: Literature search yielded 62 questionnaires, 57 which assessed sexual function from the patient perspective; 12 were general and 45 specific. Six domains were commonly represented, including interest and desire, satisfaction/quality of experience, excitement/arousal, performance, attitude/behavior, and relationship. Only 28% could be used in homosexual patients, and 52% were applicable to both genders; 57% were designed for use in chronic disease populations. Only nine questionnaires had evidence for both adequate reliability and validity. CONCLUSIONS: Current measures of sexual functioning often exclude important domains, lack applicability to gender and sexual preference groups, or lack adequate testing of validity and testing in important populations.

Record.create(abstract: %q[In clinical trials, a wide range of outcome measures has been used to evaluate the severity of psoriasis and its response to treatment. Despite their widespread use, many measures have received little attention with regards to their reliability and validity, Selecting an appropriately developed measurement tool is therefore of critical importance. We conducted a literature survey to examine the status of clinical outcome measures used in psoriasis research. The measures most commonly used were individual sign scores, e.g. for erythema, plaque thickness or scaling, and pooled indices, e.g. the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. None of these, however, systematically fulfilled all the requirements of a validated instrument for disease assessment. Ideally, a core set of reliable and validated outcome measures for use in all psoriasis clinical trials is needed. Objective instrumental methods should minimise observer variation, but unless a simple non-invasive method can be developed, the uptake of such technology will probably be limited by cost and lack of practicality. Moreover, the translation of instrumental readings into clinically relevant measures is always a major problem, and for none of the methods has there been a robust mapping of instrumental readings on to a clinically meaningful scale, Further research is needed to determine the most appropriate and sensitive parameters to use as surrogate measures for capturing the distress which psoriatic patients feel but which is not measured with sufficient sensitivity or precision with current quality of life or distress questionnaires.], accnum: %q[WOS:000082192700001], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: [], author: ["Ashcroft, D.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Nail involvement is a common feature of psoriasis, predicting higher disease severity and greater impairment in quality of life. Valid assessment of nail psoriasis is relevant for research and routine clinical use. However, no measurement standards have currently been developed. OBJECTIVE: To identify state-of-the-art outcomes measurements in nail psoriasis by literature analysis. METHODS: Systematic Web-based literature search, followed by structured critical appraisal and consecutive descriptive report. The search focused on methodological and epidemiological publications and papers describing outcomes of clinical trials on nail psoriasis. RESULTS: Initially, 646 publications met the primary criteria. After non-relevant or replicate publications were excluded, 66 papers were analysed, including clinical trials or case reports (n = 41), reviews (n = 11) and methodological or epidemiological studies (n = 14). In total, 23 clinical outcomes measures and 15 patient-reported outcomes (PRO) tools were used. None had been validated according to recent standards. In the studies with clinical interventions (n = 41), NAPSI (Nail Psoriasis Severity Index; n = 4) or target NAPSI (n = 2) were the most often used single tools, followed by Physician's Global Assessment (n = 3). However, in 16 studies, no specifically described outcomes measures were used. CONCLUSION: Valid clinical outcomes measures in nail psoriasis are rare. Existing tools lack validation and standardisation. A need exists for accurate and scientifically sound evaluation of nail psoriasis severity in trials and clinical practice.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: We reviewed and provide recommendations about the most scientifically robust and appropriate questionnaires for evaluating symptoms and the quality of life impact of urinary and/or anal incontinence, and vaginal and pelvic floor problems. We also investigated the use of these questionnaires in randomized, controlled trials of treatment strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Symptom and Quality of Life Committee of the International Consultation on Incontinence performed a systematic review of questionnaires related to urinary and anal incontinence, and vaginal and pelvic floor problems, searching MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library and other electronic databases between 2001 and 2004. RESULTS: A total of 23 robust and relevant questionnaires could be recommended in clinical practice and research. The development of questionnaires to assess anal incontinence, and pelvic floor and vaginal problems has been limited with some promising measures but with none achieving the highest level of rigor. From 2001 to 2004 there were 150 published randomized trials of treatments for incontinence. Increasingly trials of incontinence are using recommended measures (38% of those for urinary incontinence and 22% of those for anal incontinence used the highest quality questionnaires in 2001 to 2004) but none of vaginal and pelvic floor problems used recommended questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing acknowledgment of the value of patient based assessment much attention has been given to the development of questionnaires to assess symptoms and quality of life. Sufficient measures are now available for urinary incontinence, and researchers and clinicians are encouraged to use the 18 achieving the highest level of rigor and their validated translations. In contrast, the development of questionnaires for anal incontinence and pelvic/vaginal problems is in its infancy and further study in this area is needed.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Objective. To systematically review fatigue instruments used in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to seek consensus on which instruments should be recommended for future studies and which data on comorbid conditions should be reported when evaluating fatigue in patients with SLE. Methods. We used data from Medline and EMBase databases (from January 1970 to June 2006), clinical experts, and bibliographies. Data were extracted independently by 4 authors and reviewed by a working group and larger expert panel to produce a recommendation. Instruments were examined for construct validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change. Correlations between fatigue and some components of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-:36), disease activity, and comorbidities were reviewed. Results. We identified 34 studies that used 15 fatigue instruments in patients with SLE. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was used in 56% of the studies. The Systemic Lupus Activity Measure was significantly correlated with fatigue, but the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index was not. Fatigue was also correlated with pain, poor quality of sleep, depression, and with each subscale of the SF-36. Conclusion. The working group and expert panel recommend the 9-item FSS for evaluating fatigue in SLE patients. Responsiveness to change of fatigue instruments has not been well established in SLE and needs further study. The panel suggested that an important improvement or response could be a 15% decrease in the FSS. The effect of several important confounding factors of fatigue such as sleep disorders, depression, fibromyalgia, and anemia needs to be collected and reported.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evaluating the impact of new treatments requires the use of reliable, valid, and responsive outcome measures. However, given the wide range of instruments currently available, it is not always straightforward for healthcare professionals to select the most appropriate tool. In this review, we propose a potential approach to scale selection. METHODS: In designing a new study of the impact of a robotic device in stroke rehabilitation, we developed a three-stage scale selection strategy. First, two guidance documents (Medical Outcome Trust and Food and Drug Administration PRO Guidance) were reviewed to identify key scale assessment criteria. Second, consideration was given at a theoretical level of the concepts and domains relevant to the goals our study. Third, a comprehensive literature search strategy and review were developed in conjunction with healthcare professionals and psychometricians. Identified scales were appraised regarding their psychometric properties and clinical content. RESULTS: Forty-five measures were initially identified and appraised. From a clinical content perspective, none of the measures were considered to be sufficient on their own to capture all the important outcome domains in this study. However, 3 measures were identified that best met our review criteria: Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement, Chedoke Arm and Hand Inventory, and ABILHAND. After the final stage of scale appraisal, two further upper limb scales (Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test) were included based on clinical content and study design issues.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the level of evidence of the clinimetric properties of measures of aerobic and anaerobic capacity used for children with cerebral palsy (CP). DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of databases PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO through April 2011 was performed. STUDY SELECTION: Two independent raters identified and examined studies that reported laboratory- or field-based measures of maximal aerobic or anaerobic capacity in children with CP aged 5 to 14 years. DATA EXTRACTION: The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was used by 2 independent raters to evaluate the methodologic quality of the included clinimetric studies and to identify measures used in these studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-four studies that used a maximal aerobic or anaerobic capacity measure were identified. Five studies reported clinimetric properties for 5 measures (2 aerobic and 3 anaerobic measures). Methodologic quality was excellent in 3 studies, showing good validity and reliability of field-based aerobic (Shuttle Run Test) and anaerobic (Muscle Power Sprint Test) measures. The studies on laboratory-based measures were rated fair, mainly because of inadequate statistics. The level of evidence was strong for good validity and reliability of the field-based tests. The level of evidence was unknown for validity and low to moderate for good reliability of laboratory-based tests. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of research on the clinimetric properties of measurement instruments to assess aerobic and anaerobic capacity for children with CP.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Clinical trials require valid and reliable outcome measures to facilitate the interpretation and communication of results, and the secondary use of data for systematic reviews. There are numerous tools available to assess the severity of acne vulgaris in clinical trials, and extensive debate about the merits of these. OBJECTIVES: To review the literature about investigator-assessed outcome measures used in clinical trials for acne vulgaris; and to evaluate the measurement properties of these tools. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted of articles outlining and evaluating investigator-assessed outcome measures for acne. RESULTS: Thirty-one papers met the criteria for inclusion in the literature review, including nine papers proposing a novel means of assessing acne, and five evaluating existing outcome measures. Variable attempts had been made to evaluate these tools. CONCLUSIONS: The array of evaluation tools used in acne trials prohibits good secondary analysis of trial data, and complicates the interpretation of study results, potentially compromising clinical care.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To identify patient-specific self-assessment instruments, which measure physical function in patients with musculoskeletal disorders and to evaluate the descriptive properties and the psychometric qualities of these instruments. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: After a systematic search, included instruments were evaluated psychometrically by the checklist "quality criteria for measurement properties of health status instruments." RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included, referring to 12 instruments. Nine different versions of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) were identified. The practical elaboration of the different versions of the PSFS varied widely. None of the instruments were tested on all psychometric quality criteria of the checklist. The PSFS described by Cleland et al. was most extensively investigated and obtained exclusively positive scores. Overall, construct validity, reliability, and responsiveness were evaluated most frequently. CONCLUSION: The descriptive properties and psychometric quality of patient-specific instruments measuring physical function are only partly investigated. The PSFS was the most investigated instrument: nine different versions have been evaluated psychometrically. The version of Cleland et al. was most extensively investigated, obtained exclusively positive scores following the quality criteria by Terwee et al., and could be recommended for clinical use therefore.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common malignancy in the western world, with an incidence of 98,000 in the U.K. Since 2009 the Department of Health (DoH) has collected patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) data following four common surgical procedures. However, a DoH PROM for NMSC does not exist. A systematic review of questionnaires published on patient concerns due to NMSC of the face was conducted. Keywords relevant to PROMs, NMSC and the facial region were comprehensively searched in medical databases. Inclusion criteria stipulated that questionnaires from relevant papers recruited patients with NMSC for both the item formulation and subsequent validation. Questionnaires were then discussed by a multispecialty skin cancer research team. Initially 2548 papers were found; after exclusion criteria were applied, 73 articles were retrieved. Four patient questionnaires for NMSC featured adequate development and validation according to the inclusion criteria. The Facial Skin Cancer Index (FSCI) was the only PROM specific to facial NMSC. Additional questionnaires identified included the Skin Cancer Quality of Life Impact Tool, Skindex, and Dermatology Life Quality Index. There is a scarcity of data relating to NMSC PROMs and appearance concerns. Only one questionnaire--the FSCI--was specific to patients with facial NMSC.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Refractory dyspnoea is a common and difficult to treat symptom in advanced disease. Accurate assessment helps to guide treatment and prognosis. RECENT FINDINGS: The absence of commonly agreed assessment tools has been a significant barrier to improving care through inhibition of clinical research and limitation of clinicians' ability to assess the effectiveness of their interventions. Two recently published systematic reviews on measurement tools for breathlessness identified a variety of tools but none could be recommended as gold standard. Validation of these tools in palliative care seems more appropriate than development of new tools. For clinical purposes, the combination of a unidimensional tool to assess dyspnoea severity and a multidimensional tool to evaluate the impact on a person's quality of life seem most appropriate. This review discusses the present evidence and puts forward a strategy for assessment and measurement of the symptom in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Despite a variety of measurement tools none can be recommended as gold standard for the assessment of dyspnoea. A combination of unidimensional and multidimensional tools seems to be the best for clinical assessment.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Is there a "cost of caring" for health care providers of traumatized patients? OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to review the literature on secondary traumatic stress in nurses in order to answer the following questions: What studies have been conducted on secondary traumatic stress in nurses in all clinical specialties? What instruments were used to measure secondary traumatic stress in nurses and what psychometric properties were reported? DESIGN: A systematic review. DATA SOURCES: CINAHL, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases were searched for the years 1981 to the present. Keywords used in the database searches included secondary traumatic stress, compassion fatigue, vicarious traumatization, secondary trauma, PTSD, and nurses. REVIEW METHODS: Research studies were reviewed for the following inclusion criteria: the sample included nurses, the secondary traumatic stress symptoms were measured, and the language was English. RESULTS: Seven studies were found in which researchers examined secondary traumatic stress in nurses. The samples in five of these studies consisted of all nurses, whereas in the remaining two studies, nurses were included in the samples but the results were not specifically reported for the subgroup of nurses. Presence of secondary traumatic stress was reported in forensic nurses, emergency department nurses, oncology nurses, pediatric nurses, and hospice nurses. Three instruments were identified that measured secondary traumatic stress in practitioners who care for traumatized populations: Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, Compassion Fatigue Self Test for Helpers, and the Compassion Fatigue Scale-Revised. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of secondary traumatic stress in nurses was reported in all of the studies included in this literature review. The use of small samples and a number of different instruments to measure secondary traumatic stress symptoms, however, hindered the ability to make comparisons across studies and to draw conclusions.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to conduct a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature for risk adjustment measures (RAMs) and outcome measures (OMs) for prehospital trauma research and to use a structured expert panel process to recommend measures for use in future emergency medical services (EMS) trauma outcomes research. METHODS: A systematic literature search and review was performed identifying the published studies evaluating RAMs and OMs for prehospital injury research. An explicit structured review of all articles pertaining to each measure was conducted using the previously established methodology developed by the Canadian Physiotherapy Association ("Physical Rehabilitation Outcome Measures"). RESULTS: Among the 4,885 articles reviewed, 96 RAMs and/or OMs were identified from the existing literature (January 1958 to February 2010). Only one measure, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), currently meets Level 1 quality of evidence status and a Category 1 (strong) recommendation for use in EMS trauma research. Twelve RAMs or OMs received Category 2 status (promising, but not sufficient current evidence to strongly recommend), including the motor component of GCS, simplified motor score (SMS), the simplified verbal score (SVS), the revised trauma score (RTS), the prehospital index (PHI), EMS provider judgment, the revised trauma index (RTI), the rapid acute physiology score (RAPS), the rapid emergency medicine score (REMS), the field trauma triage (FTT), the pediatric triage rule, and the out-of-hospital decision rule for pediatrics. CONCLUSIONS: Using a previously published process, a structured literature review, and consensus expert panel opinion, only the GCS can currently be firmly recommended as a specific RAM or OM for prehospital trauma research (along with core measures that have already been established and published).

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: Although there is growing interest in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) research, there is as yet no consensus regarding the preferred outcome measure. We aimed to evaluate and to compare the validity and appropriateness of available IBS outcome measures. METHODS: IBS symptom and IBS health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scales were identified through a literature search. In a panel evaluation, six reviewers independently rated the scales according to predetermined psychometric and methodological validation criteria. RESULTS: Five IBS symptom scales and five IBS HRQOL instruments were identified. Two of the symptom scales were rated as good. The Adequate Relief question scored best. This scale demonstrates responsiveness as well as face and construct validity, and its score was considered easy to interpret and appropriate for use. According to the reviewers, the IBS Severity Scoring System performed well with regard to psychometric capacities, but its practical utility was considered debatable. The properties of the other three symptom scales were suboptimal. The practical utility of the five IBS-specific HRQOL scales was considered poor. However, the reviewers agreed that, at present, the IBS Quality of Life measurement (Patrick et al.) is the best choice, because it has been the most extensively validated and shows appropriate psychometric quality. CONCLUSIONS: The Adequate Relief question is the measure of first choice when assessing global symptomatology as an outcome in IBS studies. For a more detailed IBS symptom assessment, the IBS Severity Scoring System is preferable. Finally, the IBS Quality of Life measurement scale can be used to establish changes in health-related quality of life.], accnum: %q[12526947], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Bijkerk, C.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the measurement properties of asthma severity scores for use in preschool children. METHODS: A Medline search was used to identify published asthma severity scores for use in preschool children. The measurement properties of the scores (item development, reliability, validity, responsiveness, and usability) were evaluated using a published framework. RESULTS: Ten asthma severity scores were identified, with 19 different clinical variables used as items. Interrater agreement was assessed by five scores. Only two scores--Clinical Asthma Score (CAS) and Respiratory Distress Assessment Index (RDAI)--reported good agreement based on weighted kappa-statistics (0.64-0.90). Construct validity was reported by the CAS, Clinical Asthma Evaluation Score (CAES), the Clinical Symptom Grading System (CSGS), and the Preschool Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM). Correlation coefficients between asthma severity scores and clinical measures (length of stay, drug dosing interval, O2 saturation, health professional assessment, PaO2, PaCO2) ranged from 0.47 to 0.70. Responsiveness was formally demonstrated for two scales (PRAM, CAS). CONCLUSIONS: Most asthma severity scales for use in preschool children have been informally developed.

A modified consensus-based standards for the selection of health status measurement instruments (COSMIN) checklist was applied for methodological quality assessment of the included studies. A quality assessment for statistical outcomes was used to assess measurement properties of the walking tests. Tests that were included were categorized according to the framework of the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF). Results: Thirty-two studies, evaluating 23 walking tests, were included. The tests assessed walking using the outcome measures of walking speed, walking distance, functional ambulation and walking on different surfaces. The methodological design and statistical methods of most studies evaluating reliability and criterion validity were sufficient, and found the outcome measures to be reliable and valid.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECT: The objective of this study was to identify commonly used physiological outcome measures and summarize evidence on the reliability and predictive validity of quantitative measures used in monitoring persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed through January 5, 2012, was conducted to identify publications using common outcome measures in persons with SCI and for studies that were specifically designed to evaluate the reliability and predictive validity of selected quantitative measures. Quantitative measures were defined as tests that quantify sensory and motor function, such as amount of force or torque, as well as thresholds, amplitudes, and latencies of evoked potentials that might be useful in studies and monitoring of patients with SCI. Reliability studies reporting interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) or weighted kappa coefficients were considered for inclusion. Studies explicitly evaluating correlation between measures and specific functional outcomes were considered for predictive validity. RESULTS: From a total of 121 potentially relevant citations, 6 studies of reliability and 4 studies of predictive validity for quantitative tests met the inclusion criteria. In persons with incomplete SCI, ICCs for both interrater and intrarater reliability of electrical perceptual threshold (EPT) were >/= 0.7 above the sensory level of SCI but were less reliable below the sensory level. Interclass correlation coefficients for interrater and intrarater reliability of the Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility, and Prehension (GRASSP) components ranged from 0.84 to 0.98. For electromyography, the ICC was consistently high for within-day tests. The overall quality of reliability of the majority of studies was poor, due to the potential for selection bias and small sample sizes. No classic validation studies were found for the selected measures, and evidence regarding the predictive validity of the measures was limited. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) may be correlated with ambulatory capacity, as well as the Barthel Index and motor index scores, but this correlation was limited for evaluation of bladder function recovery in 3 studies that assessed the correlation between baseline or initial SSEPs and a specific clinical outcome at a later follow-up time. All studies used convenience samples and the overall sample quality was low. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the reliability and validity of the quantitative measures selected for this review is limited, and the overall quality of existing studies is poor. There is some evidence for the reliability of the EPT, dermatomal SSEPs, and the GRASSP to suggest that they may be useful in longitudinal studies of patients with SCI.

Record.create(abstract: %q[This article presents a review of the literature on health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) measurements in HIV-infected patients by means of multidimensional self-report questionnaires. Since 1989, 11 HRQOL instruments have been used, the most frequently employed scales and items being derived from the Medical Outcomes Study. The 9 instruments that were evaluated for their internal consistency reliability and validity generally met the conventional levels of psychometric performance. Descriptive longitudinal and psychometric studies that examined the ability of HRQOL instruments to distinguish between diagnostic groups consistently showed that, over time, patients developed more symptoms and reported poorer physical, role and sexual functioning. Patients' psychological functioning improved or remained at approximately the same level. Despite some methodological limitations, the 4 HRQOL studies performed as part of clinical trials provided valuable information for both patients and doctors about the impact of treatment with zidovudine, interferon-alpha or epoetin (recombinant human erythropoietin) on patients' HRQOL. Future studies are needed that provide more information on the feasibility, stability and responsiveness of existing HRQOL instruments. In addition, future studies should focus on the natural history of HRQOL in HIV-infected patients, and on the impact of commonly prescribed prophylactic and antiretroviral drugs on patients' HRQOL.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To describe instrumentation, or measures, available for use in assessing the impact of pain on the quality of life (QOL) of patients, and methods to evaluate the appropriateness of these QOL measures. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PSYCHLit, and CANCERLit were searched from 1980 through 1997 to identify QOL instruments that included a pain subscale or pain-related items. DATA SYNTHESIS: Given the high prevalence of chronic diseases or conditions that include pain as a primary or secondary symptom, pharmacists should understand how pain affects the QOL of patients. Over the past two decades, emphasis has increased on developing instruments that assess health-related QOL concerns, including pain. Scores of measures--including utility measures--are available to measure general QOL in patients with conditions involving pain. Condition-specific instruments have also been developed to measure the impact of specific conditions, such as arthritis, on QOL. Guidelines are presented for evaluating QOL instrumentation, and existing measures used to evaluate the QOL of patients with acute and chronic pain are described. Pharmacists can use these guidelines to evaluate the usefulness of existing instruments for assessing the QOL of patients with pain. CONCLUSION: Using QOL measures in everyday practice may assist pharmacists in gaining insight into the effects of pain on their patients' QOL.

None of the questionnaires demonstrated satisfactory results for all properties. Most questionnaires claim to measure several domains (for example, pain, physical, emotional, and social functioning), yet dimensionality was studied in only three instruments. The internal consistency was calculated for seven questionnaires and only one received an adequate rating. Twelve questionnaires received positive ratings for construct validity, although depending on the population studied, four of these questionnaires received poor ratings too. Seven questionnaires were shown to have adequate test-retest reliability (ICC >0.70), but five questionnaires were tested inadequately. In most clinimetric studies only small sample sizes (n<43) were used. Nearly all publications lacked information on the interpretation of scores.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Although research productivity in the field of frailty has risen exponentially in recent years, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the measurement of this syndrome. This overview offers three services: first, we provide a comprehensive catalogue of current frailty measures; second, we evaluate their reliability and validity; third, we report on their popularity of use. METHODS: In order to identify relevant publications, we searched MEDLINE (from its inception in 1948 to May 2011); scrutinized the reference sections of the retrieved articles; and consulted our own files. An indicator of the frequency of use of each frailty instrument was based on the number of times it had been utilized by investigators other than the originators. RESULTS: Of the initially retrieved 2,166 papers, 27 original articles described separate frailty scales. The number (range: 1 to 38) and type of items (range of domains: physical functioning, disability, disease, sensory impairment, cognition, nutrition, mood, and social support) included in the frailty instruments varied widely. Reliability and validity had been examined in only 26% (7/27) of the instruments. The predictive validity of these scales for mortality varied: for instance, hazard ratios/odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for mortality risk for frail relative to non-frail people ranged from 1.21 (0.78; 1.87) to 6.03 (3.00; 12.08) for the Phenotype of Frailty and 1.57 (1.41; 1.74) to 10.53 (7.06; 15.70) for the Frailty Index. Among the 150 papers which we found to have used at least one of the 27 frailty instruments, 69% (n = 104) reported on the Phenotype of Frailty, 12% (n = 18) on the Frailty Index, and 19% (n = 28) on one of the remaining 25 instruments.

Record.create(abstract: %q[To review existing patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs) used in dysphonic populations to assess the procedures used in their development and the extent to which these meet current development standards for content generation and psychometric evaluation. The study is a systematic review. A systematic review of Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health, and Health and Psychosocial Instruments databases was completed using voice, quality of life, and PROMs as keywords. We identified all patient or parent-reported questionnaires measuring quality of life associated with voice disorders from the review findings. Questionnaires were appraised for adherence to international guidelines for the development and evaluation of PROMs as outlined by the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medical Outcome Trust. Nine PROMs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The quality of these questionnaires was variable with regard to instrument development and none met all of the current, recommended criteria. Of the nine questionnaires, the Voice Symptom Scale underwent the most rigorous development process. Furthermore, many instruments have been augmented to allow for proxy administration, failing to address quality of life-related issues specific to the target population. Instrument development is often overlooked when attempting to quantify patient reported outcomes in dysphonic patients. Careful instrument development procedures are required to ensure that PROMs are valid, reliable, and responsive. Our review suggests that the deficits in psychometric properties of the current voice-related PROMs may be, at least in part, due to deficits in the development process. Furthermore, these data suggest the potential utility of a novel PROM adhering to rigorous international standards to better ensure that clinicians appreciate the variables most relevant to patients with voice disorders and address some of the psychometric shortcomings of the currently used questionnaires.], accnum: %q[19185454], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Branski, R.

Record.create(abstract: %q[GOALS OF WORK: The assessment of chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting and retching (CINVR) is important and to date no review has comprehensively assessed available patient self-report tools. The aim was to undertake a review of their utility, content and psychometric properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One thousand three hundred and forty-seven citations were identified by electronic and hand searches resulting in 24 non-duplicate abstracts, 15 articles for analysis, and six articles, which fitted the inclusion criteria. E-mail investigations discovered a further scale, resulting in seven measures. RESULTS: The review highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of current tools. The multiple domains, phases and aspects of CINVR signify that the assessment tools varied markedly. The diverse requirements of research and clinicians also contribute to the variation. There was a notable disparity in the quality of scales and paucity in terms of their development and psychometric evaluation. We found that several self-assessment scales currently perceived as well-validated tools have problems in terms of their validity, reliability and appropriateness. CONCLUSIONS: The constituents of a scale relevant for both clinical and research use were assessed and it was recommended that a modular tool focusing on two domains (nausea and vomiting); two phases (acute and delayed); measuring the aspects of occurrence, frequency, intensity alongside duration and functional interference; and antiemetic use and adverse events should be developed. Based on these recommendations, further research into an appropriate scale would minimise conceptual confusion, increase clinicians' understanding and control of CINVR, decrease patient distress and could have equal utility in both a clinical and a research setting.], accnum: %q[18551323], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Brearley, S.

Studies were reviewed to identify any descriptions of diary development and whether diary format, duration, or content had been subject to validity testing. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred sixty-three studies were identified using the described search terms. Of these 81 were deemed potentially relevant to the investigation and reviewed. Fourteen studies investigated optimum diary duration but only four described the development of a new diary tool. There is limited evidence regarding the validation of dairy content and format. No study describes the use of content, construct, or criterion validity as well as tests of reliability and responsiveness for diary development and validation.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Palliative sedation is the intentional lowering of consciousness of a patient in the last phase of life to relieve suffering from refractory symptoms such as pain, delirium and dyspnoea. AIM: In this systematic review, we evaluated the use of monitoring scales to assess the degree of control of refractory symptoms and/or the depth of the sedation. DESIGN: A database search of PubMed and Embase was performed up to January 2010 using the search terms 'palliative sedation' OR 'terminal sedation'. Data sources: Retro- and prospective studies as well as reviews and guidelines containing information about monitoring of palliative sedation, written in the English, German or Dutch language were included. RESULTS: The search yielded 264 articles of which 30 were considered relevant. Most studies focused on monitoring refractory symptoms (pain, fatigue or delirium) or the level of awareness to control the level of sedation. Four prospective and one retrospective study used scales validated in other settings: the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale, the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, the Communication Capacity Scale and Agitation Distress Scale. Only the Community Capacity Scale was partially validated for use in a palliative sedation setting. One guideline described the use of a scale validated in another setting. CONCLUSIONS: A minority of studies reported the use of observational scales to monitor the effect of palliative sedation.

OBJECTIVE: To give an overview of soft-tissue based methods for quantitative longitudinal assessment of facial dimensions in children until six years of age and to assess the reliability of these methods in studies with good methodological quality. DATA SOURCE: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus and CINAHL were searched. A hand search was performed to check for additional relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION: Primary publications on facial growth and treatment outcomes in children younger than six years of age were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent data extraction by two observers. A quality assessment instrument was used to determine the methodological quality. Methods, used in studies with good methodological quality, were assessed for reliability expressed as the magnitude of the measurement error and the correlation coefficient between repeated measurements. RESULTS: In total, 47 studies were included describing 4 methods: 2D x-ray cephalometry; 2D photography; anthropometry; 3D imaging techniques (surface laser scanning, stereophotogrammetry and cone beam computed tomography). In general the measurement error was below 1 mm and 1 degrees and correlation coefficients range from 0.65 to 1.0. CONCLUSION: Various methods have shown to be reliable.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Growing interest in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children with otitis media has brought the need to study the currently available HRQoL instruments with respect to their results and their applicability in clinical practice and research of otitis media. OBJECTIVE: To review existing literature on health-related quality of life research in children with otitis media with respect to: (1) the measured impact of otitis media on HRQoL; and (2) the applicability of HRQoL instruments used in research and clinical practice based on their characteristics and contents. METHODS: A search was performed in EMBASE (1988-November 2004) and on NLM Gateway (1966-November 2004) for studies assessing health-related quality of life or functional health status by means of disease-specific or generic questionnaires in children aged 0-18 years with chronic or recurrent otitis media with effusion or acute otitis media. The bibliographies of the selected articles were searched manually. RESULTS: Only 13 of the 141 retrieved articles retrieved fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. In these studies, physical suffering (pain, high fever, etc.), difficulties with hearing or speech, behavioural problems, or emotional distress were reported to be the most important problems experienced by children with otitis media. Almost all instruments applied in these studies measure functional health status instead of health-related quality of life. Data on validity and reliability of these instruments are incomplete. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent or chronic otitis media is reported to have a substantial and negative effect on various domains of functional health status and health-related quality of life of children. The OM-6 appears to be the best available instrument to assess functional health status in children with OM in a research setting.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To examine the reliability, validity, sensitivity, and practicality of various outcome measures for pain after spinal cord injury (SCI), and to provide recommendations for specific measures for use in clinical trials. DATA SOURCES: Relevant articles were obtained through a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PubMed databases from inception through 2006. STUDY SELECTION: The authors performed literature searches to find articles containing data relevant to the reliability and validity of each pain outcome measure in SCI and selected non-SCI populations. DATA EXTRACTION: After reviewing the articles, an investigator extracted information utilizing a standard template. A second investigator reviewed the chosen articles and the extracted pertinent information to confirm the findings of the first investigator. DATA SYNTHESIS: Taking into consideration both the quantity and quality of the studies analyzed, judgments on reliability and validity of the measures were made by the two investigators. Based upon these judgments, recommendations were formulated for use of specific measures in future clinical trials. In addition, for a subset of measures a voting process by a larger group of SCI experts allowed formulation of recommendations including determining which measures should be incorporated into a minimal dataset of measures for clinical trials and which ones need revision and further validity and reliability testing before use. CONCLUSIONS: A 0-10 Point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is recommended as the outcome measure for pain intensity after SCI, while the 7-Point Guy/Farrar Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale is recommended as the outcome measure for global improvement in pain.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: One of the recent advances in assessing outcomes of medical care is the inclusion of the patient perspective. The term patient-reported outcome (PRO) is used to reflect the patient perceptions of disease and its consequences as well as of treatment and health-care provision. The development of PRO measures has advanced rapidly, and implementation in clinical research and practice is now underway. From an evaluation perspective, recommendations for the choice of PRO measures and an appraisal of the potential benefits of PRO data collection within specific health conditions are needed. METHODS: Hemophilia is a rare and clinically well-defined health condition with established and cost-intensive treatment strategies, in which PRO assessment is increasingly recognized as important. For this reason, measurement of PROs in hemophilia focusing on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient preferences were reviewed to identify appropriate measures, to make recommendations for their choice, and to critically examine their impact in international hemophilia research and practice. RESULTS: Using literature searches and expert discussion strategies, generic and targeted measures for HRQoL and patient preferences in adults and children with hemophilia were screened, and 20 were reviewed on the basis of their psychometric properties and international availability. Only a few of the 20 measures have been used in clinical settings or research related to persons with hemophilia.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Although quality-of-life assessment is an important complement to conventional clinical evaluation, there are limited opportunities for researchers in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to examine evidence for a range of quality-of-life measures. To better understand how quality of life has been conceptualized, measured, and evaluated for ESRD, we conducted a structured literature review. Eligible articles were identified from a MEDLINE search, expert input, and review of references from eligible articles. A standardized instrument was created for article review and included type of measure, instrument development process, study sample characteristics, quality-of-life domains, and reliability and validity testing. From 436 citations, 78 articles were eligible for final review, and of those, 47 articles contained evidence of reliability or validity testing. Within this set, there were 113 uses of 53 different instruments: 82% were generic and 18% were disease specific. Only 32% defined quality of life.

METHODS: Relevant outcome measures were identified by searching 8 electronic databases, supplemented by citation tracking. Two independent reviewers completed data extraction and analysis of the measures using a modified version of the CanChild Outcome Measures Rating Form. RESULTS: From the 776 papers identified 5 outcome measures met the inclusion criteria: the Care and Comfort Hypertonicity Questionnaire (C&CHQ), the Caregiver Priorities and Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD), CP QOL-Child, DISABKIDS and PedsQL 3.0 CP Module. There was evidence of construct validity for all five measures. Content validity was reported for all measures except PedsQL 3.0. The CPCHILD and CP QOL-Child were the only outcome measures to have reported data on concurrent validity. All measures, with the exception of one (C&CHQ) provided evidence of internal reliability. The CPCHILD and the CP-QOL-Child had evidence of test-retest reliability and DISABKIDS had evidence of inter-rater reliability. There were no published data on the responsiveness of these outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: The CPCHILD and the CP QOL-Child demonstrated the strongest psychometric properties and clinical utility.

A number of disease-specific or condition-specific measures have been developed and applied in ophthalmology; however, their use in the specific fields of amblyopia and strabismus are not as established. The purpose of this study is to identify and discuss specific HRQoL instruments that may be used in the investigation and management of patients with amblyopia and/or strabismus. METHODS: A systematic literature review was undertaken in November 2009. The electronic databases of AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine: 1985 to November 2009), the British Nursing Index and Archive (1985 to October 2009), Ovid Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid Medline (1950 to present) and PsycINFO (1806 to November Week 1 2009) were searched. No language restrictions were applied to the search. RESULTS: Four instruments were identified: the Amblyopia and Strabismus Questionnaire (A&SQ), the Amblyopia Treatment Index (ATI), the Adult Strabismus Questionnaire (AS-20) and the Intermittent Exotropia Questionnaire (IXTQ).

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Major depression is a significant yet underdiagnosed problem of adolescence. The consequences of undiagnosed and untreated depression in this vulnerable population can have detrimental effects. School nurses are in a prime position to perform early screening and referral. However, the school environment requires special consideration as the setting for screening of adolescent depression. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to identify instruments that can be utilized by the school nurse to perform easily administered, rapid adolescent depression screenings that are valid, reliable, and economical. METHODS: An integrative review of current depression instruments used in adolescents was conducted. RESULTS: Of the seven most commonly used instruments, only four of those fit the criteria listed for conducting screening in the school setting by the school nurse. The four instruments include the Beck Depression Inventory-Youth (BDI-Y), the Children's Depression Inventory, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale for Children, and the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale. CONCLUSION: Although all four of the identified instruments provide reliability and validity in the school setting, it is the other criteria: affordability, ease of administration, and the ability of the instrument to be rapidly scored, that placed the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale for Children and the BDI-Y as the reasonable choice of instruments for use by the school nurse], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Carnevale, T."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Mental and behavioural disorders and related symptoms"], endnum: %q[50], fs: [], ghp: [], id: 67, instrument: [], issue: %q[1], journal: %q[J Child Adolesc.Psychiatr.Nurs], oql: [], pnp: ["Patient Reported Outcome"], pubyear: %q[2011], ss: [], startpage: %q[51-57], status: %q[published], title: %q[An integrative review of adolescent depression screening instruments: applicability for use by school nurses], tmi: ["1 - Questionnaires", "6 - Clinical rating scales"], url: ["PM:21272114; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00256.x/asset/j.1744-6171.2010.00256.x.pdf?v=1&t=ijwsxosq&s=d24405b102ee2e99d4dea1c56acdd01807e60bf4", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21272114"])

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To critically appraise the validity of activity indices used in the followup of patients with undifferentiated peripheral inflammatory arthritis (UPIA). METHODS: A systematic review was performed in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and abstracts presented at the 2007 and 2008 meetings of the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism. Selection criteria were: patients with UPIA, the assessment of instruments to evaluate disease activity, and assessment of validity of the instruments. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts independently and collected data using ad hoc standard forms. RESULTS: The search yielded 179 articles and 834 abstracts, of which 4 articles and 1 abstract were included. We found no study that validated Disease Activity Score (DAS), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), or Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI). Included studies addressed validation of 4 questionnaires: WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), London Handicap Scale (LHS), Disease Repercussion Profile (DRP), and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ); and 3 indexes: RA Disease Activity Index (RADAI), McGill Range of Motion Index (McROMI), and NOAR Damaged Joint Count (NOAR-DJC). Questionnaires were self-administered and feasible; RADAI was the most feasible index. Internal consistency was studied in the questionnaires (Cronbach's alpha > 0.83). Responsiveness was tested in the DRP, LHS, and HAQ, but the approach to study sensitivity to change was poorly explained, with no clear intervention. Construct validity, examined by means of convergence with other instruments, was generally moderate, and slightly higher for the RADAI.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Lower limb lymphedema (LLL) is a common complication of cancer treatment. The disease is chronic and progressive with no cure. Although a common and significant source of morbidity, the impact of this condition on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has only recently been addressed. In effort to identify valid treatment strategies for LLL, we performed a systematic review, identifying studies describing HRQOL outcomes in patients with LLL secondary to cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven medical databases were searched to identify reports using validated Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instruments on patients with cancer-related LLL. Studies were classified by levels of evidence set by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and evaluated using the Efficace criteria. 25 studies were identified, 6 met inclusion criteria. Levels of evidence included: no level I studies, level II (n=3), level III (n=1), and level 4 (n=2). 50% of studies were compliant with the Efficace criteria. 5 PRO HRQOL instruments were used, but only 1 was specific to cancer-related lymphedema. Treatment strategies assessed included complete decongestive physiotherapy (CDP), exercise, and compression bandaging. CDP yielded significant enhancements in HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: There is a deficit in high quality studies for HRQOL in patients with LLL secondary to cancer. Furthermore, of the studies present, most did not conform to guidelines set for assessment of HRQOL, nor did they use lymphedema condition specific PRO instruments.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: An essential component of evidence-based medicine is the use of valid and reliable outcome measures in clinical trials. There is much confusion in the field of atopic eczema regarding how to best measure disease severity objectively. OBJECTIVE: To establish the extent to which existing objective clinical scales for atopic eczema have been tested for validity, reliability, sensitivity to change, and acceptability. DESIGN: An electronic bibliographic search was performed for published data on all currently available named atopic eczema scales. RESULTS: Thirteen scales were identified in total. Data on construct or criterion validity were available for 10 scales. Only 5 scales had been tested for reliability (interobserver variability, intraobserver variability, or internal consistency). Data on responsiveness to change were available for 8 scales. An estimated time to administer the measure had been given for 3 scales. The only severity scale for which published data could be found on validity, reliability, sensitivity, and acceptability testing was the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index, although problems occurred with interobserver variation of the index. CONCLUSION: The rapidly increasing number of severity scales for atopic eczema, many of which have been inadequately tested, has made the interpretation of patient outcomes confusing, and comparison of results between studies almost impossible.

To analyse the psychometric properties of the respective tools, the actual guidelines for the use of patient-reported outcomes in clinical trials were applied. RESULTS: We identified five GERD-specific HRQOL questionnaires but none of them fulfilled all quality criteria; either they did not meet the actual standards for psychometric properties (HBQOL, GERD-HRQL, Jasani et al.Aust Fam Physician 1999; 28: 515), or were impracticable to use in clinical trials.

This review analyzes existing patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures in oncologic breast surgery to assess utility and make recommendations for future research. We performed a systematic literature review to identify PRO measures used in oncologic breast surgery patients. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, qualifying instruments were assessed for adherence to international guidelines for health outcomes instrument development and validation. Ten measures underwent development and psychometric evaluation in an oncologic breast surgery population. Five of ten measures (EORTC QLQ BR-23, FACT-B, HBIS, BIBCQ, and BREAST-Q) reported an adequate development and validation process. Three of these 5 measures (EORTC QLQ BR-23, FACT-B, HBIS) focused on non-surgical treatment issues. A fourth instrument (BIBCQ) did not address aesthetic concerns after breast reconstruction. The fifth instrument (BREAST-Q) was developed for use in patients undergoing mastectomy +/- reconstruction, but did not address breast-conserving therapy. Overall, two key limitations were noted: 1) surgery-specific issues of breast-conserving surgery patients were not well represented and 2) measures were largely developed without the aid of newer psychometric methods that may improve their clinical utility.

What are the criteria that determine inclusion with specific applicability in the stroke population? What are the reliability and validity of available measures in the stroke population? What is the relevance of IADL to functional outcome? SUMMARY OF REVIEW: The findings at this time indicate that there is no consensus for a clear definition of IADL. The terminology used includes the original IADL as described by Lawton and Brody, extended ADL, social ADL, and advanced ADL. Four scales that were designed primarily for use in the stroke population were identified: the Nottingham Extended ADL (a self-report scale), the Hamrin Activity Index and the Frenchay Activities Index (both based on patient interviews), and the Household section of the Rivermead ADL Assessment (a performance index). CONCLUSIONS: There is some published evidence concerning the validity, reliability, utility, sensitivity, or hierarchical nature of these indexes, and further testing is needed. The items in each index, however, have inherent relevance with potential for use in future clinical research.], accnum: %q[7762032], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Chong, D.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, representing 16% of all female cancers. According to the American Cancer Society, long-term cancer survival is defined as more than five years of survivorship since diagnosis, with approximately 2.5 million breast cancer survivors (BCS) in 2006. The long-term effects from breast cancer and its treatment have been shown to have positive and negative effects on both recovery and survivors' quality of life (QoL). The purpose of the study was to identify QoL instruments that have been validated in long-term BCS and to review the studies that have used the QoL instruments in this population. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted from January 1990 to October 2010 using electronic databases. Instruments validated and used in BCS were included in the review. In addition, QoL studies in long-term BCS using the validated instruments were reviewed. The search was limited to studies in English language. Studies of BCS of less than five years after initial diagnosis, any clinical or review studies were excluded. RESULTS: The review identified a total of 12 instruments (10 disease-specific, 2 condition-specific) validated in long-term BCS. According to the QoL framework proposed by Ferrell and colleagues, three instruments (Quality of Life-Cancer Survivors, Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors Scale, and Quality of Life Index-Cancer Version) evaluated all four domains (physical, psychological, social, and spiritual) of QoL. A review of the psychometric evaluation showed that Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors Scale has acceptable reliability, validity, and responsiveness in long-term BCS compared to other disease-specific instruments. The review also yielded 19 studies that used these QoL instruments. The study results indicated that age-group, ethnicity, and type of treatment influenced different aspects of QoL. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant impact of breast cancer on QoL in long-term BCS. The review can help researchers and clinicians select the most appropriate instruments to assess the changes in QoL in BCS.], accnum: %q[22289425], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Chopra, I.", "Kamal, K.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: Childhood illness or disability can affect the quality of life (QoL) of the child's primary caregiver. Our aim was to identify, describe the content and systematically review the psychometric properties of condition-specific QoL questionnaires for caregivers of children. METHODS: Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library databases were searched from 1 January 1990 to 30 June 2011. Articles related to the development and measurement of caregiver QoL were screened to identify condition-specific questionnaires. The characteristics of the questionnaires were extracted, and their psychometric properties were evaluated using the consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments checklist with 4-point scale. RESULTS: We identified 25 condition-specific caregiver QoL questionnaires covering 16 conditions. Conditions included atopic dermatitis, asthma, diabetes, oro-facial disorders, and two acute illnesses. Questionnaires were developed predominantly in high-income countries. Questionnaires had the highest quality rating for content validity, followed by hypothesis testing. Methodological quality was satisfactory for criterion validity; fair in reliability and responsiveness; and poor in internal consistency and structural validity. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing number of questionnaires developed over time shows improved recognition of the importance of caregiver QoL. There is a paucity of QoL questionnaires for caregivers of otherwise healthy children suffering from physical injuries and acute conditions associated with significant caregiver burden. Cultural validation of existing and new questionnaires in lower-income countries is necessary. Data collected by condition-specific questionnaires can assist clinicians and health economists in estimating caregiver burden and the types of healthcare services caregivers require and may be useful for healthcare administrators to evaluate interventions.], accnum: %q[23292299], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)"], author: ["Chow, M.

Record.create(abstract: %q[AIM: This systematic review compares the validity, reliability, and clinical use of habitual physical activity (HPA) performance measures in adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP). METHOD: Measures of HPA across Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I-V for adolescents (10-18 y) with CP were included if at least 60% of items reported HPA performance in the domains of intensity, frequency, duration, and mode. RESULTS: Seven measures of HPA performance met the criteria: StepWatch, pedometers, Uptimer, heart rate flex method, accelerometers, and self-report measures including the Children's Activity Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) scale and the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents. The CAPE scale had the strongest validity and reliability but was limited by its inability to measure activity intensity. No study was identified that evaluated the psychometric properties of physical activity measures in non-ambulant adolescents with CP (GMFCS levels IV and V). INTERPRETATION: When deciding on an appropriate measure of HPA in adolescents with CP, clinicians need to consider their research question including the domains of HPA they are evaluating and the population they wish to assess. Accelerometers provide the most robust information about the patterns of HPA, with some evidence of validity but limited data on reliability.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: The use of quality of life (QoL) instruments in menorrhagia research is increasing but there is concern that not enough emphasis is placed on patient-focus in these measurements, i.e. on issues which are of importance to patients and reflect their experiences and concerns (clinical face validity). The objective was to assess the quality of QoL instruments in studies of menorrhagia. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of published research. Papers were identified through MEDLINE (1966-April 2000), EMBASE (1980-April 2000), Science Citation Index (1981-April 2000), Social Science Citation Index (1981-April 2000), CINAHL (1982-1999) and PsychLIT (1966-1999), and by manual searching of bibliographies of known primary and review articles. Studies were selected if they assessed women with menorrhagia for life quality, either developing QoL instruments or applying them as an outcome measure. Selected studies were assessed for quality of their QoL instruments, using a 17 items checklist including 10 items for clinical face validity (issues of relevance to patients' expectations and concerns) and 7 items for measurement properties (such as reliability, responsiveness, etc.). RESULTS: A total of 19 articles, 8 on instrument development and 11 on application, were included in the review. The generic Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF36) was used in 12/19 (63%) studies. Only two studies developed new specific QoL instruments for menorrhagia but they complied with 7/17 (41%) and 10/17 (59%) of the quality criteria. Quality assessment showed that only 7/19 (37%) studies complied with more than half the criteria for face validity whereas 17/19 (90%) studies complied with more than half of the criteria for measurement properties (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Among existing QoL instruments, there is good compliance with the quality criteria for measurement properties but not with those for clinical face validity. There is a need to develop methodologically sound disease specific QoL instruments in menorrhagia focussing both on face validity and measurement properties.], accnum: %q[12206918], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)"], author: ["Clark, T.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: Apathy is highly prevalent among neuropsychiatric populations and is associated with greater morbidity and worse functional outcomes. Despite this, it remains understudied and poorly understood, primarily due to lack of consensus definition and clear diagnostic criteria for apathy. Without a gold standard for defining and measuring apathy, the availability of empirically sound measures is imperative. This paper provides a psychometric review of the most commonly used apathy measures and provides recommendations for use and further research. METHODS: Pertinent literature databases were searched to identify all available assessment tools for apathy in adults aged 18 and older. Evidence of the reliability and validity of the scales were examined. Alternate variations of scales (e.g., non-English versions) were also evaluated if the validating articles were written in English. RESULTS: Fifteen apathy scales or subscales were examined. The most psychometrically robust measures for assessing apathy across any disease population appear to be the Apathy Evaluation Scale and the apathy subscale of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory based on the criteria set in this review. For assessment in specific populations, the Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating for patients with Alzheimer's dementia, the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for schizophrenia populations, and the Frontal System Behavior Scale for patients with frontotemporal deficits are reliable and valid measures. CONCLUSION: Clinicians and researchers have numerous apathy scales for use in broad and disease-specific neuropsychiatric populations. Our understanding of apathy would be advanced by research that helps build a consensus as to the definition and diagnosis of apathy and further refine the psychometric properties of all apathy assessment tools.], accnum: %q[21193104], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Clarke, D.

This paper provides a brief systematic overview of the transplant-specific PRO measures, and their psychometric properties, developed and used in solid organ transplant recipients to date. PRO measures may focus on or encompass different aspects of life relevant to organ transplant patients: overall quality of life (QOL), physical, psychological and social functioning, and adherence. Overall QOL can be measured using transplant-specific or generic QOL instruments, or a combination of both. In general, very little information is available on the psychometric properties of PRO measures, and there is no gold standard for PRO measurement. Transplant-specific and generic PRO instruments are complementary.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To provide a systematic literature review of the responsiveness of patient-reported health outcomes measures for the evaluation of low back pain (LBP). METHODS AND DESIGN: Searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE were performed for articles published in English through June 29, 2009 using the search terms "back pain" or "low back pain" and "questionnaires" or "instrument" or "survey" or "measure" or "patient report outcome." Information on responsiveness was gathered through additional measure-specific searches that included the measure name, first author of the original paper, and "respons*" or "sensit*." Responsiveness was determined based on use of a receiver operating characteristics curve or effect size statistics. RESULTS: Of 43 identified measures, 31 were reported as being responsive to treatment or clinical change, 25 of which were evaluated for responsiveness using methods considered adequate. When considering both the responsiveness evaluation and the underlying factor structure, 13 measures were identified as being adequately validated for use in evaluating responsiveness in the research or clinical practice setting. The majority of the LBP outcome assessment studies were comprised of patients undergoing physical and interventional therapies from clinical practice and clinical trials. The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and the Oswestry Disability Index were the most comprehensively validated measures with respect to responsiveness.

Without methodologically adequate scales the accuracy of information obtained on the prevalence of needs, predictors of risk, and the potential success of any interventions, can be questioned. This review assessed the psychometric properties of measures designed specifically to identify the psychosocial health of this unique population. METHODS: Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL and EMBASE databases were searched to identify measures developed to assess the psychosocial health of AYA cancer survivors. Searches were limited to the years 1998-2008. A search of Medline revealed that the number of publications related to the assessment of psychosocial well-being in AYA cancer survivors prior to this period were minimal. The psychometric properties of identified measures were evaluated against pre-determined and generally accepted psychometric criteria including: reliability (internal consistency and test-retest); validity (face, content, construct, and criterion); responsiveness; acceptability; and feasibility. RESULTS: Seven quality of life measures met the inclusion criteria. No measures of unmet need were identified. All seven measures reported adequate internal consistency, face, content, and construct validity. Test-retest reliability, criterion (predictive) validity, responsiveness, acceptability, and feasibility were rarely examined.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Drug-induced dyskinesia is a common phenomenon in Parkinson's disease (PD) and is often socially as well as physically disabling for patients. The Movement Disorders Society commissioned a task force to assess available clinical rating scales, critique their clinimetric properties, and make recommendations regarding their clinical utility. A task force composed six clinical researchers who systematically searched the literature for scales measuring dyskinesia in PD, evaluated the scales' previous use, performance parameters, and quality of validation data (if available). A scale was designated "Recommended" if the scale has been used in clinical studies beyond the group that developed it, has been specifically used in PD reports, and if clinimetric studies have established that it is a valid, reliable, and sensitive. "Suggested" scales met two of the above criteria and those meeting one were "Listed." Based on the systematic review, eight rating scales for dyskinesia that have either been validated or used in PD were identified. These were the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part IV, the Obeso Dyskinesia Rating Scale, the Rush Dyskinesia Rating Scale, the Clinical Dyskinesia Rating Scale (CDRS), the Lang-Fahn Activities of Daily Living Dyskinesia Scale, the Parkinson Disease Dyskinesia Scale (PDYS-26), and the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS). Based on this review, at present two of the reviewed dyskinesia scales (AIMS and the Rush Dyskinesia Rating Scale) fulfill criteria for Recommended for use in PD populations, albeit weakly so; all of the remaining met criteria to be Suggested. However, the two most recent scales (PDYS-26 and UDysRS) have excellent clinimetric properties and appear to provide a reliable and valid assessment tool of dyskinesia in PD.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the psychometric properties and clinical utility of measures of sensation in neurological conditions to inform future research studies and clinical practice. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and AMED) were searched from their inception to December 2010. REVIEW METHODS: Search terms were used to identify articles that investigated any sensory measures in neurological conditions. Data about their psychometric properties and clinical utility were extracted and analyzed independently. The strength of the psychometric properties and clinical utility were assessed following recommendations. (1) RESULTS: Sixteen sensory measures were identified. Inter-rater reliability and redundancy of testing protocols are particular issues for this area of assessment. Eleven were rejected because they were not available for a researcher or clinician to use. Of the remaining five measures, the Erasmus MC modifications of the Nottingham Sensory Assessment and the Sensory section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment showed the best balance of clinical utility and psychometric properties. CONCLUSION: Many measures of sensory impairment have been used in research but few have been fully developed to produce robust data and be easy to use.

Record.create(abstract: %q[AIMS: To review and make recommendations about the format and quality of health-related self-report measures for children aged 3-8 years. METHODS: Literature searches used to identify measures of QOL, self-esteem, self-concept and mental health. The format (i.e., scale type, presentation style) and quality (i.e., item generation, reliability, validity, responsiveness) of measures were compared and evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty three measures were identified: QOL (n = 25, 47%), self-esteem/concept (n = 15, 28%), mental health (n = 13, 25%). Likert scales were used most frequently to represent response choices (n = 34, 64%). The authors of 11 (21%) measures provided justification for their scale choice. Items were most commonly presented in written format (n = 24, 45%). Item content was generated from the respondent population in only 21 (40%) measures. Twenty-seven (51%) measures reported internal reliability between 0.70 and 0.90, and 12 (23%) reported reproducibility in this range. Although validity was reported for 48 (91%) measures, evidence for three or more aspects occurred for only 9 (17%). Eleven (21%) measures evidenced responsiveness to change.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Introduction. Tests of upper-extremity motor function used for people following a stroke have been described, but reliability and validity (psychometric properties) of measurements obtained with these tests have not been consistently established. This investigation was performed: (1) to review literature relative to upper-extremity motor function testing during rehabilitation following a stroke, (2) to develop selection criteria for identifying these tests in the literature, and (3) to rate the tests relative to their psychometric properties. Method. Literature searches were done using 2 databases. Reports of 4 psychometric properties were sought: interrater reliability, test-retest reliability, convergent validity or concurrent validity, and predictive validity. Results. Nine tests met the inclusion criteria of having psychometric properties reported in the literature. No test had evidence for all 4 psychometric properties. Only the Nine-Hole Peg Test was supported by 3 out of 4 properties. Most tests had 2 properties Supported. Concurrent validity or convergent validity was most frequently described; test-retest reliability was least frequently described. Conclusions. More complete psychometric support is needed for upper-extremity motor function tests applied following a stroke. The absence of psychometric support, however, does not mean that a test has no value.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: The emergence of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in stroke has been accompanied by the widespread use of stroke classifications and scales that measure deficit (stroke scales) or resulting long-term handicap (handicap and disability scales). Although the accuracy of some scales and classifications has been studied, there is no updated systematic review appraising all of them. REVIEW: We reviewed the literature and selected 21 studies on classifications and scales. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, achieved the highest interobserver agreement among seven stroke classifications. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the Canadian Neurological Scale, and the European Stroke Scale had the highest reliability across items among nine stroke scales. The Barthel Index was the most reliable disability scale. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the most reliable stroke classifications and scales should encourage their use in selection of homogeneous populations of patients for clinical research studies and to improve communication among scientists.

Relevant papers were found in a search of the Embase electronic bibliographic database, for English language papers (published 1980-99) reporting on the psychometric testing of sexual function questionnaires. Existing published reviews or collections of such instruments were also searched, and the reference lists of all papers obtained were "back-searched" to identify other measures. Included measures were evaluated in a systematic manner using published standards concerning the validity, internal consistency, and reproducibility of health measurement scales and quality of life measures. Twenty-three self-report measures were identified for inclusion in this review. A further 2 measures were identified by reviewers of this paper after the main searches were undertaken. One measure was found not to be exclusively self-report. Eleven (46% of 24 included measures) did not meet minimum published standards for reliability, internal consistency, and validity. However one of these was reliable and valid in the female-version only. Of the 14 reliable and valid measures, or versions thereof (58% of 24), 2 (8% of 24) met "superior" psychometric standards.

METHODS: A systematic search strategy for methods of tophus measurement was formulated. For each method, papers were assessed by two reviewers to summarise information according to the specific components of the Outcomes Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) filter: feasibility, truth and discrimination. Detailed images were obtained to construct the reference guide. RESULTS: Eight methods of tophus measurement were identified: counting the total number of tophi, physical measurement using tape measure, physical measurement using Vernier callipers, digital photography, ultrasonography (US), MRI, CT and dual energy CT. Feasibility aspects of the methods are well documented. Physical measurement techniques are more feasible than advanced imaging methods, but do not allow for assessment of intra-articular tophi or for data storage and central reading. The truth aspect of the filter has been documented for many methods, particularly Vernier callipers, US, MRI and CT. Reliability of most methods has been reported as very good or excellent. Sensitivity to change has been reported for all methods except MRI and CT. CONCLUSION: A variety of methods of tophus assessment have been described for use in clinical trials of chronic gout.

AIMS: To identify and describe measures of social participation that may be specifically useful when measuring participation in people with aphasia. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A systematic review of the literature concerning participation instruments was conducted. Then six speech and language therapists evaluated the suitability of selected participation measures for use in people with aphasia and a systematic literature review concerning the feasibility, internal consistency, validity, reliability and responsiveness of the measures selected by the therapists was carried out. RESULTS: In total 12 instruments measuring aspects of participation were found: seven measured actual performance and five measured actual performance combined with experienced problems. Two were considered unsuitable for people with aphasia, leaving 10. Six speech and language therapists working with people with aphasia scored the 10 selected instruments, and two instruments were judged as possibly suitable for use in people with aphasia: the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) and the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL). However, the Community Integration Questionnaire is much closer to the concept of participation. The literature review concerning the psychometric properties of the Community Integration Questionnaire revealed that very little is known about the use of this instrument in people with aphasia.

Analysis permitted sorting the instruments as generic measures (59%), patient-preference measures (15%), and disease-specific measures (26%). Studies using the most commonly used disease-specific instrument, the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF), reported minimal psychometric testing. Within the HD population, multidimensional QOL instruments that are adequately tested, reliable, and valid are needed.

Reviews of QOL instruments tend to report only basic properties of the instruments such as domains and psychometric properties. This paper seeks to appraise critically the conceptual underpinnings of paediatric QOL instruments. A systematic review was conducted to identify QOL instruments for children aged 0 to 12 years, and to examine and compare their conceptual frameworks, definitions employed, and structure. Both generic and condition-specific measures were reviewed. Fourteen generic and 25 condition-specific QOL instruments were identified. Eleven types of definition of QOL and health-related QOL and three theories of QOL were identified. QOL was measured by a variety of domains including emotional, social and physical health, and well-being. Items commonly assessed difficulties, or intensity/frequency of feelings/symptoms, in contrast to positive aspects of life and happiness. The findings highlight the diversity that is apparent in the conceptualization of paediatric QOL and draw attention to the lack of empirical evidence for many of the fundamental assumptions.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: To identify and evaluate the lower extremity amputee (LEA) rehabilitation outcome measurement instruments that quantify those outcomes that have been classified within the ICF category of activities. This was done to assist the clinicians in the selection of the most appropriate instrument based upon four determinants of successful LEA rehabilitation and outcome measurement. METHOD: A systematic review of the literature associated with outcome measurement in LEA rehabilitation was conducted. Only articles containing data related to metric properties (reliability, validity or responsiveness) for an instrument were included. Articles were identified by electronic and hand-searching techniques and were subsequently classified first according to the ICF and then by their clinical use. RESULTS: Seventeen instruments were identified that were classified into one of (A) walk tests, (B) mobility grades and (C) indices (generic and amputee-specific). Evidence about metric properties and clinical utility was summarised in tables which formed the basis for conclusions and recommendations pertaining to LEA rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: All instruments examined have the potential for some use within the initial rehabilitation trial following amputation.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Sleep dysfunction can manifest in several ways, ranging from insomnia to somnolence, and from disrupted sleep to lack of restful sleep. Measuring sleep dysfunction is an area of active research and there exist a number of patient-reported outcome instruments that measure various aspects of sleep dysfunction. However, these instruments have not been evaluated systematically. We used a conceptual model of sleep that included four physical domains of general interest to patients and investigators, and cover the breadth of this disorder: sleep initiation; sleep maintenance; sleep adequacy; and somnolence. We next considered the additional health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL) domains of psychological and social functioning, progressing along the continuum to include health perceptions and opportunity. We then conducted a literature review to identify instruments and, using criteria developed by the Medical Outcomes Trust Scientific Advisory Committee, evaluated these instruments for their potential use in measuring sleep dysfunction. Twenty-two instruments were identified. Six instruments were found to include the four physical domains defined a priori (Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study - Sleep Problems Measures, Pittsburgh Sleep Diary, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Self-Rated Sleep Questionnaire and the Sleep Dissatisfaction Questionnaire). Several additional instruments addressed at least some of the domains and thus may be useful for specific purposes. A few instruments addressed overall HR-QOL, but did not include all four domains of interest (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, Quality of Life in Insomniacs and the Sleep-Wake Activity Inventory). Two instruments had undergone extensive psychometric evaluation (Medical Outcomes Study - Sleep Problems Measures and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), with only the latter reporting information about interpretability. Our review indicates that measuring sleep dysfunction in adults is an area of active research and that much work still needs to be completed, specifically the study of interpretability and the application of patient preferences or item response theory.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To compare available instruments for assessing delirium in critically ill adults that have undergone validity testing and provide clinicians with strategies to incorporate these instruments into clinical practice. DESIGN: Medline (1966-September 2006) was searched using the key words: delirium, cognitive dysfunction, assessment, intensive care unit, and critical illness to identify assessment tools that have been used to evaluate delirium in critically ill adults. A special emphasis was placed on delirium assessment tools that have been properly validated. Data on how these tools have been adopted into clinical practice as well as strategies for clinicians to improve delirium assessment in the ICU are highlighted. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Six delirium assessment instruments including the Cognitive Test for Delirium (CTD), abbreviated CTD, Confusion Assessment Method-ICU, Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist, NEECHAM scale, and the Delirium Detection Score were identified. While each of these scales have undergone validation in critically ill adults, substantial differences exist among the scales in terms of the quality and extent of the validation effort, the specific components of the delirium syndrome each address, their ability to identify hypoactive delirium, their use in patients with a compromised level of consciousness, and their ease of use.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Facial disfigurement is often experienced by head and neck cancer (HNC) patients following surgery and has a significant impact on their quality of life (QOL). The aim of the current review is to assess patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures for use in HNC patients, appraise the psychometric properties of QOL instruments that include an appearance domain and determine which instrument/s might be the most appropriate for use in HNC patients in clinical practice and research. METHOD: A systematic search of the English-language literature was performed using the Medline and PsycINFO electronic databases. PRO measures designed to assess QOL and the impact of disfigurement on QOL were identified. Instruments were evaluated based on their development and validation criteria, appearance domain content and use in assessing QOL outcomes in HNC patients. RESULTS: From 530 articles, 18 QOL questionnaires were identified. Only five PRO instruments were considered suitable for review: University of Washington QOL questionnaire (UWQOLQ); Head and Neck Survey (HNS); European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck 35 (EORTC QLQ-H&N35); Derriford Appearance Scale 59 (DAS59) and the Derriford Appearance Scale 24 (DAS24). The UW-QOL has better coverage of appearance issues than the EORTC QLQ-H&N35 and the HNS, is well validated and demonstrates promising psychometric properties. The DAS24 and DAS59 which are devoted solely to appearance issues and are not specific to HNC, have had psychometric properties tested in large scale studies, but have only been used in clinical practice in a limited number of studies. CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests the UW-QOL is the most appropriate screening tool to assess appearance issues in clinical practice.

Methods Electronic searches were performed in the Cochrane, PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO databases up to August 2011. Two reviewers independently rated the measurement properties of clinical tests of impairments, defined by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as problems in body structure or body function, using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN). Best evidence synthesis was made using COSMIN outcomes and the quality of findings was assessed using a purpose criteria system. Results Fifteen of 2,588 publications were eligible for inclusion. Impairments evaluated were range of motion (ROM; 9 studies), muscle strength (6 studies), tenderness (3 studies), leg length discrepancy (2 studies), balance (2 studies), and muscle length (2 studies) in people with hip osteoarthritis (OA), hip fractures, and mixed hip/groin pathologies. Measurement properties evaluated included reliability, measurement error, construct validity, and criterion validity. Responsiveness and interpretability were not assessed. Intrarater reliability of ROM tests (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.820.97) and strength tests (ICC 0.840.98) for hip OA and of strength tests (ICC 0.660.86) and balance tests (ICC 0.730.94) for hip fractures was demonstrated. Conclusion This systematic review highlighted a paucity of literature evaluating the clinimetric properties of impairment tests for people with hip and/or groin pathology.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Introduction: There is no universally accepted measurement scale to assess breathlessness in adult palliative care patients. This significantly hampers clinical practice and research into effective interventions. The aim is to systematically identify and appraise breathlessness measurement scales, which are validated for use in palliative care or which show potential for use. Methods: We undertook systematic searches of electronic databases (Cochrane databases 2005, MEDLINE 1966-2005, OLDMEDLINE 1950-1965, EMBASE 1980-2005, PsycINFO 1872-2005, AMED 1985-2005, CINAHL 1982-2005, SIGLE 1980-2005) with follow-up searches (reference lists of included papers, handsearches of relevant journals). The basic search strategy was 'breathlessness (etc.) AND measurement (scales, validation etc.) AND palliative care/cardiac failure/respiratory disease/neoplasm etc.', modified for each database, without language restriction. Patient-based scales with evaluations of at least two psychometric characteristics were included. Exercise-based tests were excluded. Scales were appraised with particular emphasis on construct validity and responsiveness.Results: We identified 29 scales: six to measure breathlessness severity, four to assess breathlessness descriptions, and 19 to measure functional impact of breathlessness.Severity: The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and modified Borg Scale have been evaluated in COPD (the NRS has also been evaluated in cancer). Both require further assessment of responsiveness and test-retest reliability over time intervals relevant to palliative care. Visual Analogue Scales have also been evaluated, but require larger sample sizes than NRS for evidence of intervention effectiveness. Descriptions: The Japanese Cancer Dyspnoea Scale (CDS) has been evaluated in patients with cancer, but requires further assessment of construct validity and responsiveness. Functional impact: The Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire dyspnoea subscale (CRQ-D) has been evaluated in chronic lung diseases and heart failure; the MND Respiratory Scale is similar. CRQ-D has face and construct validity, test-retest reliability and responsiveness, and shows promise for palliative care. Conclusion: The NRS, modified Borg, CRQ-D and CDS appear most suitable for use in palliative care, but further evaluation is required before adopting any scale as standard.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: To examine the issue of pain assessment in infants by acquiring all available published pain assessment tools and evaluating their reported reliability, validity, clinical utility, and feasibility. DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic integrative review of the literature was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE and CINAHL (through February 2004), and Health and Psychosocial Instruments, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews (through 2003). MeSH headings searched included "pain measurement," with limit of "newborn infant"; "infant newborn"; and "pain perception." SUBJECTS: Thirty-five neonatal pain assessment tools were found and evaluated using predetermined criteria. The critique consisted of a structured comparison of the classification and dimensions measured. Further, the population tested and reports of reliability, validity, clinical utility, and feasibility were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 35 measures reviewed, 18 were unidimensional and 17 were multidimensional. Six of the multidimensional measures were published as abstracts only, were not published at all, or the original work could not be obtained. None of the existing instruments fulfilled all criteria for an ideal measure; many require further psychometric testing. CONCLUSIONS: When choosing a pain assessment tool, one must also consider the infant population and setting, and the type of pain experienced. The decision should be made after carefully considering the existing published options. Confidence that the instrument will assess pain in a reproducible way is essential, and must be demonstrated with validity and reliability testing. Using an untested instrument is not recommended, and should only occur within a research protocol, with appropriate ethics and parental approval.

Record.create(abstract: %q[This paper provides a systematic review on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures in diabetic patients. For each included study, a description of the measure and its psychometric findings is provided. To evaluate these measures, a databases search (Medline, Scopus and Proqolid) was undertaken to identify relevant publications. Instruments were assessed according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sixteen instruments met the inclusion criteria among 1049 references produced: appraisal of diabetes scale (ADS), audit of diabetes-dependent quality of life (ADDQoL), diabetes-39 (D-39), diabetes care profile (DCP), diabetes distress scale (DDS), diabetes health profile (DHP-1, DHP-18), diabetes impact measurement scales (DIMS), diabetes quality of life measure (DQOL), diabetes quality of life clinical trial questionnaire-revised (DQLCTQ-R), diabetes-specific quality of life scale (DSQOLS), elderly diabetes burden scale (EDBS), insulin delivery system rating questionnaire (IDSRQ), quality of life with diabetes questionnaire (LQD), problem areas in diabetes scale (PAID), questionnaire on stress in diabetic patients-revised (QSD-R) and well-being enquiry for diabetics (WED). All those instruments have been developed in northern countries. The shortest instrument (ADS) has seven items and the longest (IDSRQ) has 67 items. ADDQoL was widely translated followed by DHP and PAID. Only authors of ADS and DIMS have not involved patients in the construction of instruments. The authors of instruments: ADS, ADDQoL, DHP, D-39, and PAID reported the item-total correlation which is ranged from 0.28 to 0.84. The ADS, DQOL, EDBS, IDSRQ, LQD, PAID, QSD-R, and WED have been assessed for test-retest reliability which varies between 0.27 and 0.99. The DQLCTQ-R, DQOL and IDSRQ were not subjected to factor analysis. Responsiveness was assessed in PAID with effect sizes and ranged from 0.32 to 0.65 for interventions. Four domains were responsive to clinical change in metabolic control in DQLCTQ-R. The other instruments were not been formally assessed for responsiveness. This review found evidence that the instruments: ADDQoL, D-39, DDS, DHP1/18, DSQOLS, EDBS and QSD-R had adequate psychometric properties.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the available literature on measuring pain and the efficacy of pain treatment in inflammatory arthritis (IA), as an evidence base for generating clinical practice recommendations. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2008/2009 meeting abstracts, searching for studies evaluating clinimetric properties of pain measurement tools in IA (convergent validity, internal consistency, retest reliability, responsiveness, feasibility, and standardization). Studies that presented information on these properties were reviewed and their data were integrated into the pool of results available for pain measures in IA. RESULTS: In total, 51 articles were included in the review. Validated information on pain was available for tools covering different facets such as overall pain, anatomically specific pain, or a mixture of both. Data from these studies showed that single pain-related items such as the visual analog scale (VAS), numeric rating scale (NRS), or verbal rating scale (VRS) provide sufficient clinimetric information. Similar results were obtained for the pain subscales of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS/AIMS2) and the bodily pain subscale of the Medical Outcome Study Short-Form Survey 36. Most clinimetric coefficients showed acceptable results with respect to validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change, while the degree of standardization and feasibility mostly filled at least 2 of 3 predefined criteria. CONCLUSION: A variety of pain measures are available to cover different aspects of pain such as intensity, frequency, or location.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic review of psychometric properties of self-reported questionnaires used to assess the level of symptoms and disability in individuals with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). METHODS: A structured search was conducted in four databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, SportDiscus). A total of 24 studies about five different self-reported questionnaires were analyzed. A pair of independent raters extracted data on validity, reliability and responsiveness to change, and performed critical appraisal (0-100%). RESULTS: Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm Scale (LS) present excellent test-retest reliability (weighted average intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC] > 0.80), whereas Functional Index Questionnaire (FIQ) is moderately reliable (ICC = 0.61). Minimal detectable change is 8.3% for ADLS, 9.0% for AKPS, 19% for FIQ, 8.5% for IKDC and 30% for LS. ADLS, AKPS, IKDC and LS are highly responsive (effect size/standardized response mean >0.95) in individuals with PFPS, while FIQ is lowly responsive (effect size = 0.49). CONCLUSION: Based on available evidence, ADLS presents the best psychometric properties and should be preferred when evaluating patients with PFPS. AKPS and IKDC are also adequate, while FIQ and LS are not recommended for individuals with PFPS. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: While several questionnaires have been developed to assess symptoms and functional limitations caused by knee pain, their psychometric properties can vary depending on the condition presented by the patient. The Activities of Daily Living Scale of the Knee Outcome Survey should be preferred by clinicians when evaluating a patient with PFPS.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has a considerable impact on older adults' independence and autonomy. Recently, patient reported outcomes (PROs) such as QoL have been met with increasing interest by the scientific community, healthcare payers and planners. Against this background, the multitude of psychometric tools used to measure QoL in AMD was reviewed. METHODS: A search of the literature from 1990 onwards yielded 355 results, out of which 58 publications were included in the review. Data regarding design, validation and extent of utilization were obtained where available. RESULTS: The National Eye Institute-Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25-item) was found to be the most often used (29% of studies) and best validated psychometric tool, followed by the Visual Function Questionnaire (VF-14; 17%), and the Impact of Vision Impairment Profile (IVI; 9%). Most tools that were identified have been validated for the use in AMD patients. CONCLUSION: Psychometric tools specifically designed to measure vision-related quality of life are well equipped and validated to measure QoL in AMD. More recent developments such as the Macular Disease-dependent Quality of Life (MacDQoL) questionnaire might be able to depict dimensions of vision-related QoL in greater depth.

DATA SOURCES: The literature search was performed in 3 databases (Pubmed, CINAHL, Embase) up to March 2012. STUDY SELECTION: To be retained for detailed review, studies had to report on at least one psychometric property of one or many spasticity assessment tool(s) used to evaluate cerebral palsy children and adolescents. DATA EXTRACTION: Two raters independently reviewed admissible articles using a critical appraisal scale and a structured data extraction form. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 19 studies examining 17 spasticity assessment tools in cerebral palsy children and adolescents were reviewed. None of the reviewed tools demonstrated satisfactory results for all psychometric properties evaluated, and a major lack of evidence concerning responsiveness was emphasized.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: Clinicians commonly assess posture in persons with musculoskeletal disorders and tend to do so subjectively. Evidence-based practice requires the use of valid, reliable and sensitive tools to monitor treatment effectiveness. The purpose of this article was to determine which methods were used to assess posture quantitatively in a clinical setting and to identify psychometric properties of posture indices measured from these methods or tools. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review. Pertinent databases were used to search for articles on quantitative clinical assessment of posture. Searching keywords were related to posture and assessment, scoliosis, back pain, reliability, validity and different body segments. RESULTS: We identified 65 articles with angle and distance posture indices that corresponded to our search criteria. Several studies showed good intra- and inter-rater reliability for measurements taken directly on the persons (e.g., goniometer, inclinometer, flexible curve and tape measurement) or from photographs, but the validity of these measurements was not always demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Taking measurements of all body angles directly on the person is a lengthy process and may affect the reliability of the measurements.

Selected instruments were evaluated based on 11 measurement standards related to item information, versatility, practicality, breadth and depth of health measure, reliability, validity, and responsiveness. VHI and V-RQOL each met 7 of 11 criteria, with VHI showing additional preferable item information, practicality, and reliability over V-RQOL and V-RQOL showing preferable responsiveness properties over VHI.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Symptom assessment using questionnaires has been recommended as the primary outcome measure in clinical gastroesophageal reflux and dyspepsia trials. Questionnaires should have proven reliability, validity, and responsiveness, and may assess the frequency and/or severity of dyspepsia symptoms. Although a number of measures have been developed, it remains unclear which of these should be used in new trials. OBJECTIVE: To describe existing questionnaire outcome measures that assess symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux dyspepsia for use in clinical trials. METHODS: Studies were identified from Medline, Embase, the Cochrane library, and reference lists. The inclusion criterion was that the study assessed a questionnaire, which measured the frequency or severity of dyspepsia or gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, in a sample of patients. RESULTS: No direct comparison between questionnaires was possible due to methodological heterogeneity. Thirty-seven studies describing 26 questionnaires met the inclusion criteria. Twelve were unidimensional (assessed symptoms only) and 14 were multidimensional (also assessed quality of life). Eleven questionnaires assessed both frequency and severity of dyspepsia, and 10 had proven reliability, validity, and responsiveness. No studies compared different questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Future gastroesophageal reflux and dyspepsia clinical trials should use unidimensional or multidimensional outcome measures that assess both the frequency and severity of symptoms, and have proven reliability, validity, and responsiveness. Further research is necessary to compare existing outcome measures to determine which are the most reliable, valid, and responsive instruments.], accnum: %q[15667506], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Fraser, A.", "Delaney, B.", "Moayyedi, P."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Diseases of and symptoms related to the digestive system"], doi: %q[10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.40122.x], endnum: %q[478], fs: [], ghp: [], id: 134, instrument: [], issn: %q[0002-9270 (Print)], issue: %q[2], journal: %q[Am J Gastroenterol], oql: [], pnp: ["Patient Reported Outcome", "Non-patient Reported Outcome"], pubyear: %q[2005], ss: ["Physical state"], startpage: %q[442-52], status: %q[published], title: %q[Symptom-based outcome measures for dyspepsia and GERD trials: a systematic review], tmi: ["1 - Questionnaires", "6 - Clinical rating scales"], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15667506"])
Record.create(abstract: %q[Given the importance of accurately and reliably assessing disability in future clinical trials, which will test therapeutic strategies in acute spinal cord injury (SCI), we sought to appraise comprehensively studies that focused on the psychometric properties (i.e., reliability, validity, and responsiveness) of all previously used outcome measures in the SCI population. The search strategy included Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Two reviewers independently assessed each study regarding eligibility, level of evidence (using Sackett's criteria), and quality. Of 363 abstracts captured in our search, 36 full articles fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eight different outcome measures were used to assess disability in the SCI population, including Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Spinal cord Injury Measure (SCIM), Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI), Quadriplegia Index of Function (QIF), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Timed Up & Go (TUG), 6-min walk test (6MWT), and 10-m walk test (10MWT). While 19 of 36 studies provided level-4 evidence, the remaining 17 articles were classified as level-2b evidence. Most of the instruments showed convergent construct validity in the SCI population, but criterion validity was not examined due to the lack a gold standard for assessment of disability. All instruments were tested in the rehabilitation and/or community setting, but only FIM was examined in the acute care setting. Based on our results of quality assessment, the SCIM has the most appropriate performance regarding the instrument's psychometric properties. Nonetheless, further investigations are required to confirm the adequate performance of the SCIM as a comprehensive measure of functional recovery in patients with SCI in rehabilitative care.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is an increasingly common condition affecting patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL). However, there is little literature comparing HF-specific instruments. Our aim was to evaluate and compare data on the conceptual model and metric properties (reliability, validity and responsiveness) of HF-specific HRQL instruments, by performing a systematic review with meta-analyses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 2,541 articles initially identified, 421 were full-text reviewed. Ninety-four reported data on five questionnaires: Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), Chronic Heart Failure Questionnaire (CHFQ), Quality of Life Questionnaire for Severe Heart Failure (QLQ-SHF), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Left Ventricular Dysfunction (LVD-36) questionnaire. Metric properties (reliability, validity and responsiveness) were summarised using meta-analysis for pools above five estimates. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were generally high (0.83-0.95) for overall scores and scales measuring physical health. Associations with four validity criteria (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class, six-minute walk test [6MWT] and short form-36 [SF-36] 'Physical' and 'Social Functioning') were moderate to strong (0.41-0.84), except for those between two CHFQ domains (fatigue and dyspnoea) and the NYHA (0.19 and 0.22). Pooled estimates of change from eight meta-analyses showed the MLHFQ to be highly responsive, with changes in overall score ranging from -9.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.1; -15.2) for placebo to -17.7 (95% CI: -15.3; -20.2) for pacing devices.

Record.create(abstract: %q[AIMS: To identify available disease-specific measures of health-related quality of life (HRQL) for diabetes and to review evidence for the reliability, validity and responsiveness of instruments. METHODS: Systematic searches were used to identify instruments. Instruments were assessed against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Letters were sent to authors requesting details of further instrument evaluation. Information relating to instrument content, patients, reliability, validity and responsiveness to change was extracted from published papers. RESULTS: The search produced 252 references. Nine instruments met the inclusion criteria: Appraisal of Diabetes Scale (ADS), Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL), Diabetes Health Profile (DHP-1, DHP-18), Diabetes Impact Measurement Scales (DIMS), Diabetes Quality of Life Measure (DQOL), Diabetes-Specific Quality of Life Scale (DSQOLS), Questionnaire on Stress in Diabetic Patients-Revised (QSD-R), Diabetes-39 (D-39) and Well-being Enquiry for Diabetics (WED). The shortest instrument (ADS) has seven items and the longest (WED) has 50 items. The ADS and ADDQoL are single-index measures. The seven multidimensional instruments have dimensions covering psychological well-being and social functioning but vary in the remainder of their content. The DHP-1 and DSQOLS are specific to Type 1 diabetes patients. The DHP-18 is specific to Type 2 diabetes patients. The DIMS and DQOL have weaker evidence for reliability and internal construct validity. Patients contributed to the content of the ADDQoL, DHP-1/18, DQOL, DSQOLS, D-39, QSD-R and WED. The authors of the ADDQoL, DHP-1/18, DQOL, DSQOLS gave explicit consideration to content validity. The construct validity of instruments was assessed through comparisons with instruments measuring related constructs and clinical and sociodemographic variables.

METHODS: Instruments were identified through systematic searches of the literature. Information relating to instrument content, patient population, reliability, validity and responsiveness was extracted from published papers. RESULTS: The 16 instruments that met the inclusion criteria varied in length from 4 to 42 items. The majority form a single index; six produce a profile of scores. Eight have been evaluated in patients with a variety of knee problems. All instruments have satisfactory internal or test-retest reliability. However, there is limited empirical support for the health domains of six instruments. Patients informed the development of items within just five instruments. Few authors gave explicit consideration to the size of expected relationships in tests of construct validity. Eleven instruments have evidence for responsiveness to changes in health.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Breathlessness on exertion is common in people with obesity. Assessments of breathlessness may include sensation (intensity, sensory quality or unpleasantness) and/or the behavioral/emotional consequences of the sensation (respiratory-related functional impairment, disability or quality of life). This systematic review of primary studies published since 2005 evaluated how has the sensation of breathlessness been assessed in adults with increased adiposity. A total of 41 articles were retained from the systematic search strategy resulting in 20 instruments. The Modified Borg Scale (perceived exertion-intensity), the Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale and Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI; both assess respiratory-related functional impairment) were, respectively, the most frequently reported instruments. Few instruments had been tested for reliability and validity in people with increased adiposity. Visual Analog Scale, Modified Borg Scale, descriptors of sensory quality, MRC and BDI can be recommended as instruments based on their psychometric properties (reliability (correlations >0.8)and concurrent validity (correlation with severity of airways obstruction and walking distance)). A greater number of instruments were identified that assessed the consequences of the breathlessness rather than breathlessness as a sensation. If sensation drives behavior, comprehensive data on the sensation of breathlessness might assist in understanding the behavioral consequences of interventions.

Structured oral assessment enables a more informed and accurate identification of signs and symptoms and will enable early and individualized interventions. OBJECTIVE: A United Kingdom-based mouth-care group conducted a systematic review of the published literature through to March 2004 and repeated in 2008. The goal of this review was to identify and evaluate the range of instruments used to assess oral mucositis to recommend in evidence-based guidelines the "best" instrument to use in the field of children's and young people's cancer care. METHODS: Search sources included the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Studies were selected using defined criteria and reviewed by 3 pairs of group members. RESULTS: Fifty-four individual oral assessment instruments were identified with only 15 reporting evidence of reliability and validity testing. Only 3 articles reported on oral assessment exclusively in our population. CONCLUSIONS: The guidelines recommend only 1 assessment instrument, the Oral Assessment Guide, or adaptations of this instrument, to be used in clinical practice. Five factors influenced this recommendation: purpose of assessment, population, outcomes assessed, and quality of the instrument and ease of use.

Record.create(abstract: %q[AIM: This systematic review aimed to compare the validity, reliability, evaluative validity, and clinical utility of upper limb activity measures for children aged 5 to 16 years with congenital hemiplegia. METHOD: Electronic databases were searched to identify assessments that measure upper limb activity available for use and for which published validity and reliability data for the population are obtainable. Assessment items were coded according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) categories to determine if at least 35% of the assessment items fell within the activity component of the ICF. Assessments that met these criteria were included in the review. RESULTS: Thirty-eight measures were identified, and five met the inclusion criteria. The best measure of unimanual capacity was the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function (MUUL); however, the Shriners Hospital Upper Extremity Evaluation (SHUEE) and the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) could also be considered, depending on the type of information required. The performance-based measure of bimanual upper limb activity in children with hemiplegia with the best psychometric properties was the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA).

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To (a) identify post-concussion symptom scales appropriate for children and adolescents in sports; (b) review evidence for reliability and validity; and (c) recommend future directions for scale development. DESIGN: Quantitative and qualitative literature review of symptom rating scales appropriate for children and adolescents aged 5 to 22 years. INTERVENTION: Literature identified via search of Medline, Ovid-Medline and PsycInfo databases; review of reference lists in identified articles; querying sports concussion specialists. 29 articles met study inclusion criteria. RESULTS: 5 symptom scales examined in 11 studies for ages 5-12 years and in 25 studies for ages 13-22. 10 of 11 studies for 5-12-year-olds presented validity evidence for three scales; 7 studies provided reliability evidence for two scales; 7 studies used serial administrations but no reliable change metrics. Two scales included parent-reports and one included a teacher report. 24 of 25 studies for 13-22 year-olds presented validity evidence for five measures; seven studies provided reliability evidence for four measures with 18 studies including serial administrations and two examining Reliable Change. CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric evidence for symptom scales is stronger for adolescents than for younger children. Most scales provide evidence of concurrent validity, discriminating concussed and non-concussed groups. Few report reliability and evidence for validity is narrow.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: There are many methods to evaluate female sexual function and dysfunction (FSD) in clinical and research settings, including questionnaires, structured interviews, and detailed case histories. Of these, questionnaires have become an easy first choice to screen individuals into different categories of FSD. AIM: The aim of this study was to review the strengths and weaknesses of different questionnaires currently available to assess different dimensions of women's sexual function and dysfunction, and to suggest a simple screener for FSD. METHODS: A literature search of relevant databases, books, and articles in journals was used to identify questionnaires that have been used in basic or epidemiological research, clinical trials, or in clinical settings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Measures were grouped in four levels based on their purposes and degree of development, and were reviewed for their psychometric properties and utility in clinical or research settings. A Sexual Complaints Screener for Women (SCS-W) was then proposed based on epidemiological methods. RESULTS: Although many questionnaires are adequate for their own purposes, our review revealed a serious lack of standardized, internationally (culturally) acceptable questionnaires that are truly epidemiologically validated in general populations and that can be used to assess FSD in women with or without a partner and independent of the partner's gender. The SCS-W is proposed as a 10-item screener to aid clinicians in making a preliminary assessment of FSD.

This systematic review was conducted to critically evaluate pediatric evidence on frequency of occurrence, validity of outcome measures, and prognostic indicators of post-thrombotic syndrome. DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of original reports revealed 19 eligible studies, totaling 977 patients with upper/lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. Calculated weighted mean frequency of post-thrombotic syndrome was 26% (95% confidence interval: 23-28%) overall, and differed significantly by prospective/non-prospective analysis and use/non-use of a standardized outcome measure. RESULTS: Standardized post-thrombotic syndrome outcome measures included an adaptation of the Villalta scale, the Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Pathologic classification, and the Manco-Johnson instrument. Data on validity were reported only for the Manco-Johnson instrument. No publications on post-thrombotic syndrome-related quality of life outcomes were identified. Candidate prognostic factors for post-thrombotic syndrome in prospective studies included use/non-use of thrombolysis and plasma levels of factor VIII activity and D-dimer.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The objective of this review was to evaluate health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) measures for use with patients with stroke. HR-QOL measures are increasingly used for assessment in many health conditions; these measures may serve an important role in evaluating the impact of stroke and of stroke interventions. HR-QOL measures used in patients with stroke should: (i) cover the domains of HR-QOL that may be affected by stroke; (ii) have administration characteristics suitable for use in patients with stroke; and (iii) have undergone reliability and validity assessment in patients with stroke. The present study evaluates HR-QOL measures with reference to these requirements. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify and evaluate HR-QOL measures of potential use in studies of patients with stroke. Identified measures were assessed with regard to stroke-relevant domains covered, measure characteristics (e.g. self-administration versus administration by an interviewer, interviewer time to complete) and psychometric properties of reliability and validity. The measures evaluated vary widely on domains covered, and limited assessment of the performance of HR-QOL measures has been conducted in patients with stroke. No existing measure comprehensively covers all relevant domains or addresses fully the issues of obtaining and combining HR-QOL assessments in patients and proxies in many stroke populations.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of venous leg ulcers on health-related quality of life and analyse the quality of life instruments that have been used for this topic. BACKGROUND: Venous leg ulcers represent more than 80% of all chronic leg ulcers. Several studies have demonstrated that health-related quality of life is affected in patients with such lesions. METHOD: An integrative review was conducted, together with an additional methodological review of quality of life instruments. Eight electronic databases were searched, and all studies published between 2003 and 2008 were considered in with both qualitative and quantitative approaches and in Spanish, English, French, German and Portuguese. Thus, no restrictions were applied as regards study design. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included; one used mixed methods, three employed qualitative methods and the remaining articles used a quantitative approach. Pain was the factor most frequently identified as affecting health-related quality of life. The generic instruments most commonly used were Short Form-36 and adaptations, the Nottingham Health Profile and EuroQol-5, whilst the disease-specific tools were Hyland, Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule and Charing Cross Venous Leg Ulcer Questionnaire. Two new instruments were also identified, venous leg ulcer quality of life and Sheffield Preference-based Venous Leg Ulcer 5D. CONCLUSIONS: The negative impact of venous leg ulcers on health-related quality of life is confirmed in this review. This impact has been measured using a variety of specific health-related quality of life instruments.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: Pressure ulcers are a major health problem, affect patient psychological, physical and social functioning, and cause significant treatment burden. For comprehensive assessment of the benefits of an intervention, patient-reported evidence of the impact of an intervention on important patient outcomes should be made. We systematically reviewed the quality of life literature on chronic wounds to determine the suitability of generic and chronic wound-specific outcome measures for use in evaluating patient outcomes in pressure ulcer research. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature. DATA SOURCES: Searches of eight electronic databases from inception until May 2012 were undertaken. REVIEW METHODS: Quality of life domains, item content and content relevance were determined for identified outcome measures. The content validity of identified measures was assessed against an empirically derived pressure ulcer-specific conceptual framework. RESULTS: Three generic and 14 chronic wound measures were identified but no pressure ulcer-specific measures. None of the existing measures cover all quality of life domains important in pressure ulcers. One condition-specific measure, the Venous Leg Ulcer Measure, matched most closely conceptually, but failed to represent three important domains and contained items not specific to pressure ulcers.

Record.create(abstract: %q[AIM: This paper is a report of a systematic review to assess the adequacy of measures evaluating generic health-related quality of life outcomes in children less than 5 years old. BACKGROUND: Evaluating generic health-related quality of life outcomes in children is important to assess the effectiveness of interventions, nursing care and services. METHODS: A methodological systematic review was carried out for the period 1980-2005 in accord with the UK Centre of Reviews and Dissemination guidelines on systematic reviews. We searched multiple electronic databases, hand-searched key texts, and contacted investigators. We included all English language publications describing primary empirical research of generic health-related quality of life, health status, functional status or wellbeing measures, with published psychometric evidence. All measures (proxy and/or self-complete) for use in children under 5 years were included; single dimension measures were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy-six papers (70 studies) referring to 16 generic health-related quality of life measures met our inclusion criteria. None of the 16 measures were adequate in terms of their conceptual content or psychometric criteria; quality scores were poor (0-8). No current, generic health-related quality of life measure is both psychometrically and conceptually robust, although the Health Utilities Index has the most comprehensive psychometric data published. However, not all dimensions of health are assessed, with little evidence of reliability in children under 5 years of age.

Record.create(abstract: %q[AIM: This systematic review investigated the availability of assessment tools to evaluate bimanual skills in young children (< or = 3y) with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Evidence for validity, reliability, and clinical utility of the identified instruments was sought. METHOD: Ten electronic databases and grey literature were searched (earliest 1806) to February 2009 to identify articles that met criteria related to the child's age and diagnosis, and included a discrete bimanual assessment. Further searches for evidence of psychometric properties of each identified assessment were undertaken. For quality criteria, we evaluated the internal validity of each study and appraised the validity and reliability of identified assessments. RESULTS: From 1435 papers retrieved, 15 were eligible for inclusion, and 11 assessments of bimanual performance were identified. Ten assessments had inadequate evidence for reliability and validity. Only the Assisting Hand Assessment had evidence for reliability and validity for its intended purposes. INTERPRETATION: Reliability and validity are fundamental considerations when developing or selecting assessments. Additional considerations for assessing young children include the following: (1) standardized administration and scoring; (2) items that capture the complexity of bimanual behaviour; and (3) protocols and items targeted within a small age range to meet specific developmental needs. A validated assessment of younger infants is needed to support early intervention during this period of rapid brain development.], accnum: %q[20059510], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Greaves, S.", "Imms, C.", "Dodd, K.", "Krumlinde-Sundholm, L."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Diseases of and symptoms related to the nervous system"], doi: %q[10.1111/j.1469-8749.2009.03561.x], endnum: %q[342], fs: ["Physical functioning"], ghp: [], id: 153, instrument: [], issn: %q[1469-8749 (Electronic)], issue: %q[5], journal: %q[Dev Med Child Neurol], oql: [], pnp: ["Patient Reported Outcome", "Non-patient Reported Outcome"], pubyear: %q[2010], ss: [], startpage: %q[413-21], status: %q[published], title: %q[Assessing bimanual performance in young children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy: a systematic review], tmi: ["4 - Performance-based tests", "7 - Observations", "2 - Interviews", "5 - Videos"], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20059510"])
Record.create(abstract: %q[Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) remains the principal dose-limiting toxicity of many agents. This systematic review evaluates available CIPN measures and provides rationale for selection of measures in this field. Searches of Medline (1966-2010), CINAHL (1966-2010), Embase (1966-2010), and Cochrane (1988-2010) databases were performed. To be selected, studies had to include (1) subjects receiving peripheral neurotoxic chemotherapy for cancer and (2) a primary purpose of psychometric evaluation of CIPN measures. A modified Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool coded psychometric study quality, with 0-7 score overall possible (higher score indicating better quality). A total of 15 studies qualified for evaluation. Overall studies were of moderate quality, with 10 of 15 receiving a 4-5 QUADAS score. Averaged quality scores for two repeatedly studied measures, Total Neuropathy Score (TNS) versions and Functional Assessment of Cancer-Gynecologic Oncology Group, neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-Ntx), were 5.4 and 4.5, respectively. Two measures emerged as potentially useful for clinical trials and patient care. The FACT/GOG-Ntx is a subjective measure of CIPN-related quality of life (QoL). TNS clinical versions incorporate both subjective measures and objective examinations of nerve function.

Record.create(abstract: %q[STUDY DESIGN: A systematic literature review of outcome questionnaires designed for assessing functional status or disability in patients with low back pain. OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive overview of all functioning/disability questionnaires used in recent years and to explore how the main concept(s) was described or defined in the original paper, the content or the domains of disability, and the measurement properties of the questionnaires. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A number of clinical tools designed for evaluating the functional status of patients with low back pain have been developed. Only a few have been reviewed earlier, and there has been little focus on the content reflected in the questionnaires. METHODS: Papers including questionnaires for assessing disability, function, activity limitations, or participation restrictions in adult patients with low back pain were searched in the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases for the period from January 1996 to January 2002. Two independent and blinded researchers read and selected abstracts and questionnaires. The content of the included questionnaires was classified according to World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The measurement properties were analyzed according to recommended guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 36 back-specific questionnaires were identified. When distinguishing among a bodily, personal, and social perspective of functioning, 4 main types of content were identified. Most of the outcome questionnaires had a mixed content reflecting various constructs such as pain and symptoms, sleep disturbances, psychological dysfunctions, physical impairments, and social functions. Nine questionnaires assessed solely activities of daily living. For one-third of the questionnaires, the measurement properties were reported in only the original study.

Forty-six studies evaluating 12 disease-specific and ten generic QoL measures for patients, and one disease-specific measure for caregivers, satisfied all inclusion criteria. Sixteen focus group or interview studies and 51 questionnaire-based studies evaluated domains of care important to people with MS, and seven qualitative and 11 questionnaire-based studies assessed domains of care important to their caregivers. From these studies, we identified 15 domains of care important to people with MS and 12 domains important to caregivers. QoL measures differed markedly in their coverage of these care domains.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis remains a major public health problem worldwide. In recent years, increasing efforts have been dedicated to assessing the health-related quality of life experienced by people infected with tuberculosis. The objectives of this study were to better understand the impact of tuberculosis and its treatment on people's quality of life, and to review quality of life instruments used in current tuberculosis research. METHODS: A systematic literature search from 1981 to 2008 was performed through a number of electronic databases as well as a manual search. Eligible studies assessed multi-dimensional quality of life in people with tuberculosis disease or infection using standardized instruments. Results of the included studies were summarized qualitatively. RESULTS: Twelve original studies met our criteria for inclusion. A wide range of quality of life instruments were involved, and the Short-Form 36 was most commonly used. A validated tuberculosis-specific quality of life instrument was not located. The findings showed that tuberculosis had a substantial and encompassing impact on patients' quality of life. Overall, the anti-tuberculosis treatment had a positive effect of improving patients' quality of life; their physical health tended to recover more quickly than the mental well-being. However, after the patients successfully completed treatment and were microbiologically 'cured', their quality of life remained significantly worse than the general population. CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis has substantially adverse impacts on patients' quality of life, which persist after microbiological 'cure'.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) are common in both outpatient and inpatient settings. However, the proportion of preventable ADEs varies considerably in different studies, even when conducted in the same setting, and methods for assessing the preventability of ADEs are diverse. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to identify and systematically evaluate methods for assessing the preventability of ADEs. DATA SOURCES: Seven databases (Cochrane, CINAHL, EMBASE, IPA, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science) were searched in September 2010 utilizing the databases' index terms and other common terminology on preventable ADEs. No limits for the years of publication were set. Reference lists of included original articles and relevant review articles were also screened. STUDY SELECTION: After applying predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria on 4161 unique citations, 142 (3.4%) original research articles were included in the review. One additional article was included from reference lists. Outcome measures of included studies had to include the frequency of ADEs and the assessment of their preventability. Studies were excluded if they focused on individuals with one specific type of treatment, medical condition, medical procedure or ADE. DATA EXTRACTION: Measurement instruments for determining the preventability of ADEs in each article were extracted and unique instruments were compared. The process of assessing the preventability of ADEs was described based on reported actions taken to standardize and conduct the assessment, and on information about the reliability and validity of the assessment. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eighteen unique instruments for determining the preventability of ADEs were identified. They fell under the following four groups: (i) instruments using a definition of preventability only (n = 3); (ii) instruments with a definition of preventability and an assessment scale for determining preventability (n = 5); (iii) instruments with specific criteria for each preventability category (n = 3); and (iv) instruments with an algorithm for determining preventability (n = 7). Of actions to standardize the assessment process, performing a pilot study was reported in 21 (15%), and use of a standardized protocol was reported in 18 (13%), of the included 143 articles. Preventability was assessed by physicians in 86 (60%) articles and by pharmacists in 41 (29%) articles. In 29 (20%) articles, persons conducting the assessment were described as trained for or experienced in preventability assessment. In 94 (66%) articles, more than one person assessed the preventability of each case. Among these 94 articles, assessment was done independently in 73 (51%) articles. Procedures for managing conflicting assessments were diverse. The reliability of the preventability assessment was tested in 39 (27%) articles, and 16 (11%) articles referred to a previous reliability assessment. Reliability ranged from poor to excellent (kappa 0.19-0.98; overall agreement 26-97%). Four (3%) articles mentioned assessing validity, but no sensitivity or specificity analyses or negative or positive predictive values were presented. CONCLUSIONS: Instruments for assessing the preventability of ADEs vary from implicit instruments to explicit algorithms. There is limited evidence for the validity of the identified instruments, and instrument reliability varied significantly. The process of assessing the preventability of ADEs is also commonly imprecisely described, which hinders the interpretation and comparison of studies. For measuring the preventability of ADEs more accurately and precisely in future, we believe that existing instruments should be further studied and developed, or that one or more new instruments should be developed, and the validity and reliability of the existing and new instruments be established.], accnum: %q[22201475], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Hakkarainen, K.

Eighteen measures met the selection criteria. Six were published with some description of the development process and 12 were developed ad hoc. Less than half were based on an explicit definition of quality of dying and death and even fewer relied on a conceptual model that incorporated multidimensionality and subjective determination.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: Quality of life (QOL) is often considered the primary endpoint in research, clinical medicine, and health promotion when impairments are incurable or insufficiently understood. For spinal cord injured (SCI) persons extended life spans and the need for life-long follow-up make it important to expand the outcome parameters of medical care and health services to include QOL measures. STUDY DESIGN: Review. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate QOL research in SCI persons from the perspective of current criteria for instrument psychometric quality developed by Medical Outcomes Trust (MOT). METHODS: Relevant articles were extracted from the Medline, Cinahl, and PsycLit databases for approximately a recent 30-year period (1966 - 1999). The keyword 'spinal cord injuries' was cross-indexed with 'quality of life', 'personal satisfaction' and 'life satisfaction'. A total of 105 articles were identified and 46 met our inclusion criteria: (a) report of original research; (b) evaluation of QOL by self-report questionnaires or scales; and (c) publication in English. RESULTS: The quality of the research designs varied widely. Most of studies were cross-sectional with limited study populations. The number of instruments or different combinations of instruments nearly equalled the number of studies conducted. Most questionnaires were condition-specific and only used by the developers. The variety of instruments and the diversity of their core content made results difficult to compare, and evaluations and conclusions unpredictable and sometimes contradictory. The low psychometric standard of many instruments used further aggravates the interpretation of results. CONCLUSION: To improve future research in special populations such as the SCI, the MOT criteria for review of QOL instruments should be further disseminated and applied to reach desirable consensus of a limited number of standardised generic and condition-specific QOL measures.], accnum: %q[11035471], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Hallin, P.", "Sullivan, M.", "Kreuter, M."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes"], endnum: %q[469], fs: [], ghp: ["Health-related quality of life"], id: 160, instrument: [], issn: %q[1362-4393 (Print)], issue: %q[9], journal: %q[Spinal Cord], oql: [], pnp: ["Patient Reported Outcome"], pubyear: %q[2000], ss: [], startpage: %q[509-23], status: %q[published], title: %q[Spinal cord injury and quality of life measures: a review of instrument psychometric quality], tmi: ["1 - Questionnaires", "6 - Clinical rating scales"], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11035471"])
Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: Cost-utility analysis is increasingly important as healthcare providers aim to invest scarce resources in interventions offering the greatest health benefit. The ability to attach utility values to health states is essential, and is increasingly performed using generic scales. However, the evidence regarding the validity of generic utility scales in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear. We summarize and review evidence on the validity and comparative performance of generic utility scales in RA. METHODS: We searched the English-language medical literature for studies using utilities in RA between 1980 and mid-2006. Reports describing primary evidence of the validity or performance of a generic utility scale in RA were selected, summarized, and reviewed using the OMERACT filter. RESULTS: In total 923 articles were identified, of which 228 reported the use of utility scales in RA; 26 studies related to the validation or evidence of generic utility scales in RA, the EQ-5D, Health Utility Index-2 (HUI2) and HUI3, SF-6D, and Quality of Well-Being Scale. The EQ-5D, HUI2 and HUI3, and SF-6D all have consistent evidence of construct validity and responsiveness in RA, but each has limitations. CONCLUSION: The EQ-5D and HUI3 have been the most extensively studied instruments and show validity and responsiveness for use in RA, but both instruments have limitations. The SF-6D is relatively new and appears to have potential for use in milder RA, but needs further evaluation. More longitudinal head-to-head evaluation of measures is needed across the spectrum of RA disease severity to further investigate their comparative properties, and to seek consensus on the best utility measure for use in economic evaluation.], accnum: %q[18278841], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Harrison, M.

Record.create(abstract: %q[This systematic review critically appraises the literature on the psychometric properties and clinical utility of evaluative activity limitation outcome measures used for children with cerebral palsy (CP). The search strategy yielded 29 articles for eight outcome measures that met the inclusion criteria for the review. The Gross Motor Function Measure and Activities Scale for Kids were found to have sound psychometric properties in most areas. Reliability was found to be adequate for all tools. For the CP population, further examination of some aspects of validity is required for the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), Functional Mobility Scale (FMS), Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI), and the Functional Independence Measure for Children. The FAQ, CHQ, FMS, and PODCI were found to require further examination for responsiveness. Clinical utility of the measures varied. The FMS was the only one to differentiate between function in the home, school, and community and to consider different assistive devices.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: 1. To identify generic and disease specific measures of impairment, functional status and health-related quality of life that have been used in adult critical care (intensive and high-dependency care) survivors. 2. To review the validity, reliability and responsiveness of the measures in adult critical care survivors. 3. To consider the implications for future policy and to make recommendations for further methodological research. 4. To review what is currently known of the outcome of adult critical care. METHODS: DATA SOURCES: Searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, The Cochrane Library and SIGLE) from 1970 to August 1998. Manual searches of five journals (1985-98) not indexed in electronic databases and relevant conference proceedings (1993-98). Reference lists of six existing reviews, plus snowballing from reference lists of all relevant articles identified. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised trials, non-randomised trials (cohort studies) and case series that included data on outcomes after discharge from adult (16 years and over) critical care. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: If reported, the following data were extracted from each paper: patient characteristics (age, gender, severity of illness, diagnostic category) number of patients eligible for study, follow-up period, number of deaths before follow-up, number and proportion of survivors included in follow-up method of presentation of outcome data - proportion normal as defined by reference values, or aggregate value (e.g. mean or median), or aggregate values plus an indication of variance (e.g. standard deviation or inter-quartile range). Evidence for three measurement properties was sought for each outcome measure that had been used in at least two studies - their validity, reliability and responsiveness in adult critical care. If the authors did not report these aspects explicitly, an attempt was made to use the data provided to provide these measurement properties. For measures that were used in at least ten studies, information on actual reported outcomes were also extracted. RESULTS: MEASURES USED IN CRITICAL CARE: Measures of impairment were largely confined to the respiratory system so are almost certainly not appropriate for many critical care survivors. They can be categorised as respiratory volumes (e.g. vital capacity), gas flow within the respiratory system (e.g. forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)), pulmonary diffusing capacity (e.g. carbon monoxide diffusing capacity) and visualisation of the upper airway (e.g. bronchoscopy). Multiple tests are often performed. Eight measures of physical functional status were used, five generic and three disease-specific. The most frequently used generic measures were multi-item scales. Two single-item global measures attempted to capture a person's overall activity level or functional status. Five multi-item measures of mental functional status were used, four generic and one specific to trauma patients. The generic measures were either confined to assessing depressive symptoms or also encompassed a measure of anxiety. Measures of neuropsychological functioning relate to a person's cognition, attention, ability to process information and memory. Apart from one single-item measure, which focused on communication level, six multi-item measures were used with critical care survivors. Such measures are particularly appropriate for use with survivors of head injury or other neurological insult and, in that sense, they are disease-specific rather than generic measures. Single item measures of recovery were frequently used but researchers often invented their own, so there was little consistency in the wording. These measures had five principal foci - return to work, return to own home, degree of recovery, productivity and chronic health status. One multi-item scale was also used.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To identify and review evidence relating to the measurement properties of published multi-item outcome measures for the conservative management of lateral ligament injuries of the ankle. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were used to identify measures, which were then assessed against pre-defined criteria relating to development, item content, reliability, validity and responsiveness. RESULTS: Seven disease-specific measures of ankle status [Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool, Clinical Trauma Severity Score, Composite Inversion Injury Scale, Kaikkonen Functional Scale (KFS), Karlsson Ankle Function Score (KAFS), Olerud and Molander Ankle Score (OMAS), and the Point System] and two generic measures of health (McGill Pain Questionnaire, Sickness Impact Profile) met the review inclusion criteria. While all measures had been used in acute injuries, only two had also been applied during later stages of recovery (>6 months). The studies covered a comprehensive range of graded ligament injuries. Expert opinion dominated item generation for all measures. All measures lack evidence of test-retest or internal consistency reliability in patients with ankle sprain. Several measures were assessed for validity through comparison with other measures, but there was limited evidence of construct validity and no formal assessment of responsiveness for any measure. CONCLUSION: The disappointing lack of evidence for measurement properties suggests that any measure should be used with caution until appropriate evidence is provided. On the basis of limited evidence, the KFS offers the most promising approach to a combined clinician- and patient-assessment of ankle function, and the KAFS or OMAS if a patient-assessed evaluation of function is required.], accnum: %q[15189400], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Haywood, K.

DESIGN: Systematic literature searches to identify instruments. Pre-defined criteria relating to reliability, validity, responsiveness, precision and acceptability. RESULTS: A total of 46 articles relating to 18 instruments met the inclusion criteria. Most evidence was found for the OARS Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire (OMFAQ), CARE, Functional Assessment Inventory (FAI) and Quality of Life Profile--Seniors Version (QOLPSV). Most instruments have been evaluated in single studies. Four instruments have evidence of internal consistency and test-retest reliability--LEIPAD, Philadelphia Geriatrics Centre Multilevel Assessment Inventory, Perceived Well-being Scale, Wellness Index (WI). Two instruments lack evidence of reliability--Brief Screening Questionnaire, Geriatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (GQLQ). Older people contributed to the content of the GQLQ, QOLPSV and WI.

RESULTS: Twelve AS-specific and three arthritis-specific instruments met the inclusion criteria. Three AS-specific instruments that measure health-related quality of life (HRQL) were reviewed. The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and the Dougados Functional Index (DFI) had the greatest amount of evidence for reliability, validity and responsiveness across a range of settings. Four instruments lacked evidence for test-retest or internal consistency reliability. Most were assessed for validity through comparisons with other instruments, global judgements of health, mobility or clinical and sociodemographic variables. Most were assessed for responsiveness through mean score changes. Three instruments lacked evidence of responsiveness. CONCLUSION: This review provides a contribution to AS assessment. AS-specific multi-item measures specific to the assessment of pain, stiffness, fatigue and global health were not identified; where assessed, these domains were largely measured with single-item visual analogue scales.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: To review the quality and acceptability of condition-specific, domain-specific and generic multi-item patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used in the assessment of adults with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). METHODS: Systematic literature searches were made to identify PROMs. Quality and acceptability was assessed against an appraisal framework, which captured evidence of both the thoroughness and results of evaluations: evidence of measurement (reliability, validity, responsiveness, interpretability, data quality/precision) and practical properties (feasibility, patient acceptability), and the extent of active patient involvement was sought. RESULTS: A total of 11 CFS/ME-specific, 55 domain-specific and 11 generic measures were reviewed. With the exception of the generic SF-36, all measures had mostly limited evidence of measurement and/or practical properties. Patient involvement was poorly reported and often cursory. CONCLUSIONS: The quality and acceptability of reviewed PROMs is limited, and recommendations for patient-reported assessment are difficult. Significant methodological and quality issues in PROM development/evaluation were identified by the appraisal framework, which must be addressed in future research.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: To identify and evaluate the lower limb amputation rehabilitation outcome measurement instruments that quantify those outcomes classified within the International classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF) category of body function or structure. This was done to summarise the current evidence base for the most commonly used outcome measurement tools and to provide clinicians with recommendations on how specific tools might be selected for use. METHOD: A systematic review of the literature associated with outcome measurement in lower limb amputation rehabilitation was conducted. Only articles containing data related to metric properties (reliability, validity or responsiveness) for an instrument were included. Articles were identified by electronic and hand-searching techniques and were subsequently classified according to the ICF. RESULTS: Sixteen instruments were identified that were classified into one of Global mental function (12), Sensory and pain (1), Cardiovascular and respiratory (1) and Neuromusculoskeletal and movement (2).

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to undertake a critical appraisal of oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) measurements used for research in the elderly. BACKGROUND: A variety of OHRQoL measurements have been developed in the past 20 years as a result of increased concern about the impact of oral conditions on a person's quality of life. There is need for an assessment aimed at prioritising the recommended measurements to be used for different purposes in the elderly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Original English language papers using measurements to assess OHRQoL in the elderly were identified from Web of Science, EMBASE, PubMed, Medline and Lilacs databases. The search included all papers published from 1985 to February 2007. The criteria of assessment were: (i) measurement criteria (number of items and domains, and classification of the results found for each measurement); (ii) quantitative-qualitative criteria (frequency, acceptability, reproducibility, reliability, sensitivity and capability of being reproduced in other language versions). RESULTS: In a total of 152 papers selected, 20 measurements were identified. However, only seven fulfilled all the measurement and quantitative-qualitative criteria. CONCLUSION: Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index, Subjective Oral Health Status Indicators, Oral Health Impact Profile-49, Dental Impact on Daily Living, Oral Health Impact Profile-14, Oral Impact on Daily Performances and German Version of the Oral Heath Impact Profile were considered as instruments of choice to assess OHRQoL in the elderly.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Health-related quality-of-life measures have been increasingly used in research into neurological disorders in recent years. The aim of this paper is to provide an objective appraisal of the evidence in regard to disease-specific quality-of-life measures used in research on health interventions for three degenerative neurological disorders: multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. A comprehensive search strategy was developed to include nine relevant electronic databases. Only studies pertaining to patient-based outcome measurements in multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease and Parkinson's disease were included. We identified 76 eligible studies. As studies consisted of descriptive and cross-sectional survey study designs, results were reported qualitatively rather than in the form of a meta-analysis. Four disease-specific measures were found for Parkinson's disease, 11 for multiple sclerosis and one for motor neurone disease.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: Neuromotor function in infancy can be evaluated in various ways. Assessment instruments are used for early detection of children with a high risk for developmental disorders. Early detection enables clinicians to provide intervention at a young age when plasticity of the nervous system is high. The assessments may also be used to monitor intervention. The present article will review the psychometric properties of methods to assess neuromotor function in infancy. METHOD: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Medline, and PsycINFO (1966-2007) on instruments to assess neuromotor functioning of infants. RESULTS: Fifteen instruments were included and classified into 4 groups: (1) Comprehensive neurological examinations (n = 4). These techniques are widely used, though little is known about their reliability. Their validity in predicting major developmental disorders such as cerebral palsy is good; their predictive validity for minor motor disorders is moderate at best. (2) Procedures with standardized scoring (n = 7). These have good reliability, but only moderate predictive validity for major developmental disorders. No data available for prediction of minor developmental disorders. (3) Observation of milestones (n = 2). Its predictive validity for major developmental disorders is only moderate, whereas reliability is good. (4) Assessment of quality of motor behavior or motor patterns (n = 2). These instruments have the best predictive validity for major and minor developmental motor disorders, but current methods are only useful under the age of 4 months. CONCLUSION: Prediction of developmental outcome at an early age is difficult. In medical evaluations of high-risk infants, the best predictions are achieved through a combination of multiple, complementary tools, that is, achieved milestones, neurological examination and assessment of the quality of motor behavior.], accnum: %q[18698195], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Heineman, K.

To evaluate the success of surgical and nonsurgical interventions in facial paralysis patients, patient satisfaction and impact on quality of life should be considered. The objective of this study is to identify existing patient-reported outcome instruments that measure quality-of-life outcomes in the facial paralysis population. METHODS: A systematic review of the English-language literature was performed to identify patient-reported outcome instruments that have been developed and validated for use in facial paralysis patients. Each qualifying measure was evaluated for content and psychometric properties, as outlined by international recommended guidelines for item generation, item reduction, and psychometric evaluation. RESULTS: From 598 articles, 28 questionnaires assessing facial paralysis were identified. Only three questionnaires satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria: the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale, the Facial Disability Index, and a questionnaire developed to study aberrant facial nerve regeneration.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: A hand and wrist disorder affects a patient's overall well-being and health-status. One concept serves as the foundation for all further consideration: in order to have confidence in your results when assessing patients with wrist and hand limitations, the clinician and researcher must choose standardised patient-oriented instruments that address the primary aims of the study. In this paper, we assess the quality of reviews published on patient oriented instruments in current use for assessing function of the hand and wrist joint. We highlight features of commonly used scales that improve readers' confidence in the choice and application of these outcome instruments. METHODS: A literature search (1950-January 2010) was performed using the MESH terms: hand (strength, injuries, joints) and wrist (injuries, joint) combined with outcome and process assessment (questionnaires, outcome assessment, health status indicators, quality of life). Titles and abstracts (n=341) were screened by two reviewers independently. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of ten reviews and the inclusion of clinimetric properties were assessed using the COSMIN checklist. RESULTS: We included three systematic reviews rated moderate to high (2 hand injury instrument reviews and 1 wrist fracture outcome review). Recommendations of use and an overview are provided for the disability of the arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire (DASH), QuickDASH, the Michigan hand questionnaire (MHQ), the patient-rated wrist hand evaluation outcome questionnaire (PRWHE) and the carpal tunnel questionnaire (CTQ) scales with established measurement properties. CONCLUSIONS: The DASH, a region-specific 30-item questionnaire is the most widely tested instrument in patients with wrist and hand injuries. The MHQ can provide good value to patients with hand injuries. Although, the CTQ is the most sensitive to clinical change, the DASH and MHQ have shown to be sufficiently responsive to outcome studies of carpal tunnel syndrome. The PRWHE has a good construct validity and responsiveness, which is only slightly better than the DASH to assess patients with wrist injuries. As the quality of patient-oriented validation continues to increase then the instruments can be selected more carefully. We will then be able to see that the future orthopaedic care of patients with hand and wrist injuries may also improve.], accnum: %q[21159335], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Hoang-Kim, A.", "Pegreffi, F.", "Moroni, A.", "Ladd, A."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes"], doi: %q[10.1016/j.injury.2010.11.050], endnum: %q[376], fs: ["Physical functioning"], ghp: [], id: 183, instrument: [], issn: %q[1879-0267 (Electronic)], issue: %q[3], journal: %q[Injury], oql: [], pnp: ["Patient Reported Outcome"], pubyear: %q[2011], ss: [], startpage: %q[253-8], status: %q[published], title: %q[Measuring wrist and hand function: common scales and checklists], tmi: ["1 - Questionnaires"], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21159335"])

We sought to review the value of these tools in assessing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with diabetes-related foot disease and identify the impact of each foot problem on life quality. METHODS: A systematic review of literature on HRQOL PROMs in diabetes-related foot disease was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality of eligible studies was evaluated within pre-existing criteria. RESULTS: 53 studies written between 1995 and 2010 met the inclusion criteria. A variety of HRQOL PROMs were used. Disease-specific tools were better than generic at quantifying temporal changes in life quality and showed greater sensitivity to ulcer/neuropathic severity. No studies have simultaneously evaluated disease-specific tools. Generic and utility HRQOL PROMs are frequently used as secondary outcome measures in randomised trials and cost-utility analysis. HRQOL is depressed in diabetes, further impaired by the presence of foot disease. Ulcer healing is associated with improvements in HRQOL. Patients with active ulceration report poorer HRQOL than those whom have undergone successful minor lower extremity amputation (LEA) but there is a paucity of quality data on HRQOL outcomes for diabetes-related LEA. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: No one PROM was identified as a 'gold standard' for assessing HRQOL in diabetes-related foot disease. Specific areas for further development include the most valid HRQOL PROM with disease-specific content; HRQOL outcomes in minor and major amputations and the role of HRQOL tools in routine clinical care.], accnum: %q[22246373], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: [], author: ["Hogg, F.

Record.create(abstract: %q[CONTEXT: Refugees experience multiple traumatic events and have significant associated health problems, but data about refugee trauma and health status are often conflicting and difficult to interpret. OBJECTIVES: To assess the characteristics of the literature on refugee trauma and health, to identify and evaluate instruments used to measure refugee trauma and health status, and to recommend improvements. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsychInfo, Health and PsychoSocial Instruments, CINAHL, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews (searched through OVID from the inception of each database to October 2001), and the New Mexico Refugee Project database. STUDY SELECTION: Key terms and combination operators were applied to identify English-language publications evaluating measurement of refugee trauma and/or health status. DATA EXTRACTION: Information extracted for each article included author; year of publication; primary focus; type (empirical, review, or descriptive); and type/name and properties of instrument(s) included. Articles were excluded from further analyses if they were review or descriptive, were not primarily about refugee health status or trauma, or were only about infectious diseases. Instruments were then evaluated according to 5 criteria (purpose, construct definition, design, developmental process, reliability and validity) as described in the published literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 394 publications identified, 183 were included for further analyses of their characteristics; 91 (49.7%) included quantitative data but did not evaluate measurement properties of instruments used in refugee research, 78 (42.6%) reported on statistical relationships between measures (presuming validity), and 14 (7.7%) were only about statistical properties of instruments. In these 183 publications, 125 different instruments were used; of these, 12 were developed in refugee research. None of these instruments fully met all 5 evaluation criteria, 3 met 4 criteria, and 5 met only 1 of the criteria. Another 8 standard instruments were designed and developed in nonrefugee populations but adapted for use in refugee research; of these, 2 met all 5 criteria and 6 met 4 criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of articles about refugee trauma or health are either descriptive or include quantitative data from instruments that have limited or untested validity and reliability in refugees.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECT: The objective of this systematic review was to use evidence-based medicine to identify valid, reliable, and responsive measures of functional outcome after treatment for cervical degenerative disease. METHODS: The National Library of Medicine and Cochrane Database were queried using MeSH headings and key words relevant to functional outcomes. Abstracts were reviewed after which studies meeting inclusion criteria were selected. The guidelines group assembled an evidentiary table summarizing the quality of evidence (Classes I-III). Disagreements regarding the level of evidence were resolved through an expert consensus conference. The group formulated recommendations that contained the degree of strength based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines network. Validation was done through peer review by the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons. RESULTS: Myelopathy Disability Index, Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and gait analysis were found to be valid and reliable measures (Class II) for assessing cervical spondylotic myelopathy. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale, the North American Spine Society scale, and the Neck Disability Index were found to be reliable, valid, and responsive (Class II) for assessing radiculopathy for nonoperative therapy. The Cervical Spine Outcomes Questionnaire was a reliable and valid method (Class II) to assess operative therapy for cervical radiculopathy.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: This systematic review reported on the clinimetric properties of outcome measures for use in clinical practice for adults with musculoskeletal conditions of the knee. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in Medline, EMBASE, Cinahl and AMED to identify studies examining the clinimetric properties of outcome measures for adults undergoing conservative treatment of ligament injuries, meniscal lesions, patellofemoral pain and osteoarthritis of the knee. Outcomes measures taking less than 20 min to administer and requiring minimal equipment and space were included. Pairs of authors used a checklist to record the characteristics of the outcome measures, their reported clinimetric properties and the demographics of the study populations. The OMERACT filters of 'truth' and 'discrimination' were applied to the data for each outcome measure by an expert panel. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were included evaluating 37 outcome measures. Ten outcome measures had adequate supporting evidence for 'truth' and 'discrimination': AAOS, AKPS, goniometer measurement, IKDC, KOOS, LEFS, Lysholm, Tegner, WOMAC and WOMET. However none of the outcome measures had been comprehensively tested across all clinimetric properties. CONCLUSION: Despite the widespread use of some outcome measures in clinical practice and primary research, data on the clinimetric properties were available for only 37 and of these only 10 had adequate supporting evidence for use in this population.

Record.create(abstract: %q[STUDY DESIGN: Comprehensive review and systematic analyses. OBJECTIVES: Assess published psychometric evidence for spinal cord injury (SCI) spasticity outcome measures. Considerations about the influence of spasticity on function have also been identified to understand treatment effects and guide service delivery. SETTING: London, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. METHOD: Review of measures was based on availability of psychometric data, application in clinical settings and evaluated in SCI patients. RESULTS: Ashworth and Modified Ashworth Scales (AS, MAS), Penn Spasm Frequency Scale (PSFS), Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spasticity (SCATS), Visual Analogue Scale self-rated scale of spasticity (VAS) and the Wartenberg Pendulum Test (WPT) were included in this review. The most frequently used tools for SCI spasticity measurement include the AS, MAS, PSFS and VAS, of which the latter two are self-report spasticity measures. The SCATS has been partially validated for SCI, but is not widely used. The WPT has been minimally validated despite its use in a large-scale SCI spasticity randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSIONS: Since spasticity is multidimensional, focusing on one or two spasticity outcome measures can misrepresent the extent and influence of spasticity on SCI patients. Different scales measure different aspects of spasticity and individual tools correlate weakly with each other. Spasticity may be better measured with an appropriate battery of tests, including the AS or MAS, along with PSFS. These tools would benefit from further reliability and responsiveness testing.

The purpose of this review was to explore the disparity of scale development approaches between families with children with disabilities and families from other populations and identify strengths to serve as a source of recommendations to improve the measurements of FQOL in the disability field. METHOD: We conducted a keyword search of 25 databases. Sixteen measurement tools on FQOL, family well-being and family satisfaction currently used in the disability field, healthcare field and general family studies published in journals from 1980 to 2009 were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the detailed analysis and comparisons of the instruments: (1) description of the primary purpose and theoretical basis; (2) identification of the tool's respondents, domains, response formats and scoring strategies to assess family systems; and (3) summarisation of available psychometric information. CONCLUSIONS: As family researchers continue their mission to conceptualise and theorise about FQOL, they should also promote the refinement of FQOL measurements and consider the implications from family instruments used in the healthcare and general family fields from the following aspects: (1) domains of FQOL; (2) units of analysis; (3) response format; (4) scoring choice; and (5) psychometric evaluation.], accnum: %q[21883596], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Hu, X.", "Summers, J.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: An important barrier in the study of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is the difficulty in measuring disease activity. We reviewed the literature on currently available global measures of disease activity in SSc. METHODS: The PubMed database (1950-2006) was searched for the key words "scleroderma" in conjunction with "disease activity" and then "disease severity." All relevant original and review articles in English and French were reviewed. Textbooks in rheumatology and pertinent secondary references were also reviewed. RESULTS: There are currently 3 tools that are used to measure disease activity globally in SSc. Physician global assessments have been commonly used but have not been formally evaluated. The Valentini Disease Activity Index is a new measure that consists of 10 variables and a resulting score ranging from 0 to 10. It appears easy to use but lacks some face and content validity and responsiveness to change has yet to be demonstrated. The Medsger Disease Severity Scale measures disease severity in 9 organ systems. However, it assesses mostly damage and is difficult to score.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: Patients with proximal femoral fractures present a difficult problem to health care systems in view of their complex presentations and co-morbidities. Traditionally, the focus of outcome measurement for this patient group has been on mortality and surgical implant success. Increasing recognition of the need to diversify outcome measurements has led to the creation and use of a number of outcome scales. We sought to examine how these scales are being used in the current literature. METHODS: Abstracts to over 4000 papers related to proximal femoral fracture research were screened to identify commonly used scales in the five main categories of general quality of life measures (QoL), Activities of Daily Living scales (ADL), mobility and physical performance scales, disease-specific scales and hip-specific scales. The 14 identified scales were then searched for directly, and papers analysed for scale usage, timing and interpretation. RESULTS: ADL scales were the most commonly used group, followed by QoL measures, which are validated for elderly patients. Scale timing and use varied widely between studies. A large number of scales were found in addition to the 14 identified scales. None of the 14 identified scales were validated for the proximal femoral fracture population. DISCUSSION: A good scale must be appropriate in content, method and clinical utility. Its method of application must be reliable, responsive, and validated for the population in question. Outcome scale usage was difficult to assess in proximal femoral fracture research due to difficulties in isolating the relevant research, and in differences in scale timing and interpretation. Scale prevalence was skewed by use by specific research groups. CONCLUSION: There is no single unifying scale in widespread use for proximal femoral fracture patients. We would recommend the validation of commonly used scales for this population, and would advise the use of scales from more than one category to assess outcome], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Hutchings, L.", "Fox, R.", "Chesser, T."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes"], endnum: %q[361], fs: ["Physical functioning"], ghp: [], id: 194, instrument: [], issue: %q[11], journal: %q[Injury], oql: [], pnp: ["Patient Reported Outcome", "Non-patient Reported Outcome"], pubyear: %q[2011], ss: [], startpage: %q[1205-1213], status: %q[published], title: %q[Proximal femoral fractures in the elderly: how are we measuring outcome?], tmi: ["1 - Questionnaires", "6 - Clinical rating scales", "4 - Performance-based tests", "7 - Observations", "2 - Interviews"], url: ["PM:21232743", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21232743"])

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: There are no recommendations on how to measure arm exercise capacity in individuals with COPD. The objectives of this study were (1) to synthesize the literature on measures of arm exercise capacity in individuals with COPD, (2) to describe the psychometric properties and the target construct of each measure, and (3) to make recommendations for clinical practice and research. METHODS: Studies conducted in patients with COPD that included a measure of arm exercise capacity were identified after searches of five electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, and Cochrane Library) and reference lists of pertinent articles. One reviewer performed data extraction, and two assessed the quality of the studies that described measurement properties, using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. RESULTS: Of 654 reports, 41 met the study criteria. Five types of arm exercise tests were identified: arm ergometry, ring shifts, dowel lifts, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, and activities of daily living. Four studies assessed the measurement properties of the unsupported upper-limb exercise test (UULEX), the 6-min pegboard and ring test (6PBRT), a test involving weight shifts, and the grocery-shelving task (GST). Validity studies were of fair to good quality, whereas reliability studies were of poor quality. CONCLUSIONS: Arm ergometry may be the best method for measuring peak supported arm exercise capacity and endurance. The UULEX, 6PBRT, and GST may better reflect activities of daily living and should be the tests of choice to measure peak unsupported arm exercise capacity (UULEX) and arm function (6PBRT and GST)], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Janaudis-Ferreira, T.", "Beauchamp, M.

METHODS: Studies that included a measure of ADLs in individuals with COPD were identified using electronic and hand searches. Two investigators performed the literature search. One investigator reviewed the study title, abstract, and full text of the articles to determine study eligibility and performed the data extraction and tabulation. In cases of uncertainty, a second reviewer was consulted. RESULTS: A total of 679 articles were identified. Of those, 116 met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven ADLs instruments were identified, of which 11 instruments were respiratory disease-specific, whereas 16 were generic. Most instruments combined instrumental ADLs (IADLs) with basic ADLs (BADLs). The majority of the instruments were self-reported; only three instruments were performance based. Twenty-one studies assessed psychometric properties of 16 ADLs instruments in patients with COPD. CONCLUSIONS: Although several ADLs instruments were identified, psychometric properties have only been reported in a few. Selection of the most appropriate measure should focus on the target construct (BADLs or IADLs or both), type of test (disease-specific vs generic and self-reported vs performance-based), depth of information obtained, and psychometric properties of the instruments.

METHODS: The Medline and EMBASE databases were searched in all years up to October 2007 for generic HRQL measures suitable for children aged 5-18 years old and validated in English or Dutch. Measures were reviewed with respect to the age range for which the measure was suitable and reliability, validity, and content related to the ICF. RESULTS: The search resulted in 1,235 hits and 21 related articles. Seventy-nine papers met the inclusion criteria, describing in total 14 measures: Child Health and Illness Profile Adolescent and Child Edition (CHIP-AE/CE), Child Health Questionnaire Child and Parent Forms (CHQ-CF87/PF50/PF28), DISABKIDS, Functional Status II (FS II)(R), Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI 2), KIDSCREEN 52/27, KINDL, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), TNO Institute of Prevention and Health and the Leiden University Hospital (TNO-AZL), TNO-AZL Children's Quality Of Life (TACQOL), and Youth Quality of Life Instrument--Research Version (YQOL-R). Measures that were suitable for a large age range were CHQ-PF50/PF28, DISABKIDS, FS II(R), HUI 2, KIDSCREEN, PedsQL, and TACQOL. All measures had moderate to good psychometric properties, except for CHQ-PF50/PF28, KINDL, and TACQOL, which had either low internal consistency or bad test-retest reliability. The measures that covered more than six chapters of the ICF domains were CHIP-AE/CE, CHQ-CF87/PF50, DISABKIDS, KIDSCREEN-52, PedsQL, and TACQOL.

Record.create(abstract: %q[With improvements in patient and graft survival after liver transplantation, recipient quality of life (QOL) has become an important focus of patient care and clinical outcomes research. To provide a better understanding of the instruments used to assess QOL in the adult liver transplant population, we conducted a systematic review of the MEDLINE database and Cochrane library. Our review identified 128 relevant articles utilizing more than 50 different QOL instruments. Generic health status instruments are the most commonly used, and among them the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) are the most prevalent. Few studies (16%) included targeted, disease-specific instruments. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Quality of Life questionnaire, the Liver Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, and the Chronic Liver Disease questionnaire are the most frequently employed targeted instruments; however, these instruments have been designed to assess QOL in patients with chronic liver disease rather than patients after liver transplantation. The present review focuses on the psychometric properties of the existing QOL instruments and discusses their individual strengths and limitations in evaluating liver transplantation recipients. The lack of a gold-standard QOL instrument for liver transplant recipients is an impediment to cross-study comparisons. We conclude that the development of a QOL instrument specifically for liver transplant recipients will improve QOL assessment in this population leading to a more nuanced understanding of the factors that influence transplant recipients' well-being.

Record.create(abstract: %q[For this report, the authors described the initial activities of the Cancer Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Sexual Function domain group, which is part of the National Institutes of Health Roadmap Initiative to develop brief questionnaires or individually tailored assessments of quality-of-life domains. Presented are a literature review of sexual function measures used in cancer populations and descriptions of the domains found in those measures. By using a consensus-driven approach, an electronic bibliographic search was conducted for articles that were published from 1991 to 2007, and 486 articles were identified for in-depth review. In total, 257 articles reported the administration of a psychometrically evaluated sexual function measure to individuals who were diagnosed with cancer. Apart from the University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index, the International Index of Erectile Function, and the Female Sexual Function Index, the 31 identified measures have not been tested widely in cancer populations. Most measures were multidimensional and included domains related to the sexual response cycle and to general sexual satisfaction. The current review supports the need for a flexible, psychometrically robust measure of sexual function for use in oncology settings and strongly justifies the development of the PROMIS-Sexual Function instrument. When the PROMIS-Sexual Function instrument is available publicly, cancer clinicians and researchers will have another measure with which to assess patient-reported sexual function outcomes in addition to the few legacy measures that were identified through this review.

Although comparative studies have been published on the measurement of health-related quality of life for gynecologic malignancies, a similar review for these benign gynecologic conditions has not been conducted. Consequently, we searched the literature systematically to identify the impact of symptoms and treatments for these conditions on health status and to report on the types and psychometric properties of the instruments used.

Forty-six studies used a questionnaire to measure health status: 34 studies (74%) used standardized instruments; of these, 23 studies (68%) used generic tools. Although a meta analysis was not possible, it appears that women with chronic pelvic pain and conditions that are associated with pelvic pain (such as endometriosis) report worse health-related quality of life.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Purpose The Food and Drug Administration's Mini-Sentinel pilot program initially aimed to conduct active surveillance to refine safety signals that emerge for marketed medical products. A key facet of this surveillance is to develop and understand the validity of algorithms for identifying health outcomes of interest (HOIs) from administrative and claims data. This paper summarizes the process and findings of the algorithm review of pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. Methods PubMed and Iowa Drug Information Service Web searches were conducted to identify citations applicable to the pulmonary fibrosis/ interstitial lung disease HOI. Level 1 abstract reviews and Level 2 full-text reviews were conducted to find articles using administrative and claims data to identify pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease, including validation estimates of the coding algorithms. Results Our search revealed a deficiency of literature focusing on pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease algorithms and validation estimates. Only five studies provided codes; none provided validation estimates. Because interstitial lung disease includes a broad spectrum of diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, the scope of these studies varied, as did the corresponding diagnostic codes used. Conclusions Research needs to be conducted on designing validation studies to test pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease algorithms and estimating their predictive power, sensitivity, and specificity.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Background: Physical decline is experienced by all palliative care patients and affects most aspects of life. Physical functioning (PF) is therefore a crucial domain for quality of life (Qol) assessments. The purpose of this study was to review how PF assessments are performed in Qol instruments developed for palliative care Methods: For identification of instruments, Medline searches up to April 2005 were performed using the terms (palliative care OR end of life care OR terminal care) AND quality of life AND (assessment OR instrument OR questionnaire). A total of 1326 hits were screened. Named OoL instruments were extracted from 240 abstracts and 46 relevant reports. Items assessing PF were then identified and classified according to activity domains as described by the WHO International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health. Results: Of 224 different instruments detected, 39 were identified as developed for palliative care. Of these, 11 included original PF assessments. Two were comprehensive performance status measures made for staff assessment, 9 were multidimensional tools including 2-7 PF items. The content and phrasing of items varied considerably. All instruments included some aspects of self-care, whereas the coverage of mobility, domestic, work - and leisure activities was inconsistent. Interpretation: Despite its importance, PF assessment seems to be a minor part of palliative care OoL instruments. Clear definitions and conceptualization of PF are needed, as well as a consensus on relevant aspects to include in improved instruments.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To identify all disease-specific health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) instruments used to assess tinnitus in clinical trials and detail their psychometric properties. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed in the bibliographical databases of PubMed and Embase to identify all articles using specific HR-QoL instruments in tinnitus trials. REVIEW METHODS: The HR-QoL instruments used in these articles were investigated in more detail, focusing on characteristics and psychometric values by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were identified by the systematic search. The most used HR-QoL questionnaire was the Tinnitus Questionnaire, followed by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, the Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire, and the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.9) and reproducibility (> 0.8) were high for all questionnaires, and there was heterogeneity in responses between patients, endorsing the use of these questionnaires for discriminative purposes. However, the responsiveness, i.e., the usefulness of these questionnaires in evaluating treatment effects, is not known yet. CONCLUSION: The HR-QoL instruments used in tinnitus trials appear not to be validated to measure effectiveness of interventions.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no consensus regarding the optimal management for patients following an Achilles tendon rupture. To allow comparisons between different treatments, a universally accepted outcome measure is required. However, there are currently a range of these reported within the literature. OBJECTIVE: To recommend the most suitable patient-reported outcome measure for the assessment of patients following an Achilles tendon rupture, based on a systematic review of first what is currently used and second evidence of validity. METHODS: The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and AMED were searched up to September 2010. Predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to identify what outcome measures are reported in the literature. Aspects of validity were defined and a checklist used to determine which aspects have been evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-one outcome measures in 50 research papers were identified. The most commonly used was the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hind-foot score. Of the 21 outcome measures, only 4 cited independent validation data. Of these four, only the 'Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score' reported evidence to support multiple facets of validity, as defined by a predetermined criteria checklist. CONCLUSIONS: The Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score was identified as the only outcome measure which has demonstrated multiple facets of validity for use in this patient group. However, even this tool has limitations. Researchers should be aware of the limitations of the available outcome measurement tools and check on their validity before use in clinical research], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Kearney, R.

RESULTS: In the literature 17 instruments that are used in paediatric rehabilitation and paediatric physical therapy to assess the functional motor abilities of children with cerebral palsy were found. While there is an urgent need for measures that can evaluate change in functional abilities, it was found that most measures are developed and validated for discriminative purposes.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The aim of this literature review was to present and to evaluate all grading systems for cervical and lumbar disc and facet joint degeneration, which are accessible from the MEDLINE database. A MEDLINE search was conducted to select all articles presenting own grading systems for cervical or lumbar disc or facet joint degeneration. To give an overview, these grading systems were listed systematically depending on the spinal region they refer to and the methodology used for grading. All systems were checked for reliability tests and those recommended for use having an interobserver Kappa or Intraclass Correlation Coefficient >0.60 if disc degeneration was graded and >0.40 if facet joint degeneration was graded. MEDLINE search revealed 42 different grading systems. Thirty of these were used to grade lumbar spine degeneration, ten were used to grade cervical spine degeneration and two were used to grade both. Thus, the grading systems for the lumbar spine represented the vast majority of all 42 grading systems. Interobserver reliability tests were found for 12 grading systems. Based on their Kappa or Intraclass Correlation Coefficients nine of these could be recommended for use and three could not. All other systems could neither be recommended nor not be recommended since reliability tests were missing. These systems should therefore first be tested before use. The design of the grading systems varied considerably. Five grading systems were beginning with the lowest degree of degeneration, 37, however, with the normal, not degenerated state. A 5-grade scale was used in six systems, a 4-grade scale in 24, a 3-grade scale in eight and a 2-grade scale in three systems. In 15 cases the normal, not degenerated state was assigned to "grade 0", in another 15 cases, however, this state was assigned to "grade 1". This wide variety in the design of the grading systems makes comparisons difficult and may easily lead to confusion. We would therefore recommend to define certain standards. Our suggestion would be to use a scale of three to five grades, to begin the scale with the not degenerated state and to assign this state to "grade 0".], accnum: %q[16172902], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Kettler, A.", "Wilke, H.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: A variety of assessment instruments have been created to identify cancer symptoms. We reviewed systematically cancer symptom assessment instruments published in English. METHODS: A systematic search of the MEDLINE database, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and EMBASE was performed. Non-peer-reviewed articles were identified through BIOSIS. Articles were accessed through the related article links in PubMed and references were searched by hand. Studies were included if the instrument had symptom assessment as the primary outcome. Quality-of-life instruments were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 21 instruments; some had undergone modification or validation. An additional 28 studies examined symptom prevalence and interrelations; many involved symptom checklists. Studies varied in design, patient characteristics, symptoms, and outcome. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity in design, study outcomes, and validation. Seventy-six articles and two conference abstracts (derived from MEDLINE, Cochrane, CINAHL, EMBASE, BIOSIS, related articles link in PubMed, and search by hand) met inclusion/exclusion criteria. The electronic search (without related links) yielded only 26% of those articles and conference abstracts that met inclusion criteria. Searches by hand of related articles identified 59% of studies. CONCLUSION: Twenty-one instruments were identified as appropriate for clinical use. The instruments vary in symptom content and extent of psychometric validation. Both comprehensive and shorter instruments have been developed, and some instruments are intended for specific symptom assessment or symptoms related to treatment. There is no ideal instrument, and the wide variety of instruments reflects the different settings for symptom assessment.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature for functional performance tests with evidence of reliability and validity that could be used for a young, athletic population with hip dysfunction. METHODS: A search of PubMed and SPORTDiscus databases were performed to identify movement, balance, hop/jump, or agility functional performance tests from the current peer-reviewed literature used to assess function of the hip in young, athletic subjects. RESULTS: The single-leg stance, deep squat, single-leg squat, and star excursion balance tests (SEBT) demonstrated evidence of validity and normative data for score interpretation. The single-leg stance test and SEBT have evidence of validity with association to hip abductor function. The deep squat test demonstrated evidence as a functional performance test for evaluating femoroacetabular impingement. Hop/Jump tests and agility tests have no reported evidence of reliability or validity in a population of subjects with hip pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Use of functional performance tests in the assessment of hip dysfunction has not been well established in the current literature. Diminished squat depth and provocation of pain during the single-leg balance test have been associated with patients diagnosed with FAI and gluteal tendinopathy, respectively. The SEBT and single-leg squat tests provided evidence of convergent validity through an analysis of kinematics and muscle function in normal subjects. Reliability of functional performance tests have not been established on patients with hip dysfunction. Further study is needed to establish reliability and validity of functional performance tests that can be used in a young, athletic population with hip dysfunction.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The World Federation of Hemophilia scoring system (WFH-1) evaluates primarily body functions and structures, whereas assessment of the whole area of functional health status is considered nowadays to be a better measure. In addition, the WFH-1 lacks psychometric properties (reliability, validity and sensitivity to change). This study aimed to gain insight into the clinimetric assessment of functional health status in patients with haemophilia by way of a systematic literature search. A standardized literature search and selection was performed on the databases of CINAHL (1982-2001), Medline (1966-2001), and PubMed (January-July 2001). Clinimetric instruments applied in the selected articles were classified based on the international classification of functioning, disability, and health (ICF) and analysed for their psychometric properties. In 19 articles published between 1979 and 2001, 34 clinimetric instruments were used to assess functional health status. Instruments were classified as measuring the ICF components body structure and function (n = 17), activities (12) and participation (4). Reliability was measured in four articles on three different instruments, the validity (construct) of the instruments for patients with haemophilia was reported in six articles on five instruments, and sensitivity to change in three articles on three instruments. The populations under study varied in number (7-9 35), mean age (21.6-50.8 years), and in the distribution of haemophilia severity. Reports on the evaluation of functional health status in patients with haemophilia are increasing.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: To provide an overview of condition-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) assessment in clinical trials of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy in adults. We describe the key measurement issues in HRQL evaluation, identify the instruments that have been used in this population, summarize the psychometric characteristics of these instruments, propose areas of HRQL most likely to change with treatment, and offer recommendations for further research. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature using repeated searches of the MEDLINE database together with a review of reference lists from published papers. Psychometric information on the instruments was gathered from published literature. RESULTS: Three epilepsy-specific HRQL measures were identified: the Epilepsy-Surgery Inventory (ESI-55), the Liverpool Assessment Battery, and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE, the 89-, 31-, and 10-item versions). One new measure, the Epilepsy Foundation of America (EFA) Concerns Index was also found. The psychometric characteristics of these instruments are discussed in relationship to performance or expected performance in a clinical trial setting. A review of descriptive studies and trials to date suggests that subscales reflecting the psychological and social domains of HRQL may be most sensitive to treatment designed to increase seizure-free periods, reduce seizure severity, and minimize undesirable side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Although evaluation of HRQL outcomes in clinical trials of epilepsy is still in its infancy, several reliable and valid condition-specific measures are available for understanding the impact of disease and treatment on HRQL. Further research is needed to determine minimal clinically important change scores and to assess the psychometric stability of measures across cultures and mode of administration (self, interview, telephone).

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To identify psychometrically sound and clinically feasible assessments of arm activities in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy for implementation in research and clinical practice. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic search was performed based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) evaluative tools at the activity level according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health; (2) previously used in studies including children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy aged 2-18 years; (3) at least one aspect of reliability and validity in children with cerebral palsy should be established. Descriptive information, psychometric properties and clinical utility were reviewed. RESULTS: Eighteen assessments were identified of which 11 met the inclusion criteria: eight functional tests and three questionnaires. Five functional tests were condition-specific, three were generic. All functional tests measure different aspects of activity, including unimanual capacity and performance during bimanual tasks. The questionnaires obtain information about the child's abilities at home or school. The reliability and validity have been established, though further use in clinical trials is necessary to determine the responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: To obtain a complete view of what the child can do and what the child actually does, we advise a capacity-based test (Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function), a performance-based test (Assisting Hand Assessment) and a questionnaire (Abilhand-Kids).

RESULTS: The search strategy identified 620 studies, of which 18 studies reported on 12 different postoperative, recovery-specific quality-of-life instruments. None of the instruments had been validated completely in line with the 8 quality criteria, which were used to assess the measurement properties. Two instruments were clearly superior, which were the Postdischarge surgical recovery scale and the Quality of recovery-40.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is one of the most common adverse effects of antipsychotic agents. The limited agreement about which rating scale should be used in clinical practice to assess DIP prompted us to review the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of the available instruments. METHODS: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched in November 2008 using the terms "parkinsonism," "scale," and "drug induced" to identify instruments used to measure DIP. Then, the literature was searched for studies investigating the use and psychometric properties of each identified instrument. Outcome measures included feasibility, validity (including appropriateness of used reference test), and reliability (internal consistency and interrater and intrarater reliability). RESULTS: Seventeen rating scales were identified, each with a different representation of the concept of parkinsonism. The Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) was used the most, followed by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. There were limited psychometric data, especially regarding validity, available for any scale. The SAS, the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Scale, and the parkinsonism subscale of the Schedule for the Assessment of Drug-Induced Movement Disorders, which is identical to the St Hans Rating Scale for Extrapyramidal Syndromes, seemed to have moderate to good reliability and acceptable validity.

Record.create(abstract: %q[One of the aims of the European Palliative Care Research Collaborative (EPCRC) is to achieve consensus on a classification system for cancer pain. We performed a systematic literature review to identify existing classification systems and domains/items used to classify cancer patients with pain. In a systematic search in the databases Medline and Embase, covering 1986-2006, 692 hits were obtained. 92 papers were evaluated to address pain classification. Six standardised classification systems were identified; three of them systematically developed and partially validated. Both pain characteristics and patient characteristics relevant for cancer pain classification were included in the classification systems. All but one of the standardised systems aim at predicting treatment response or adequacy of treatment. Several domains and items used to describe cancer pain but not formally described as part of a classification system were also identified and systematized. The existing approaches to pain classification in cancer patients are different, mostly not thoroughly validated, and none is widely applied. An internationally accepted classification system for cancer pain could improve research and cancer pain management.

Record.create(abstract: %q[AIM: A clinical trial is only as reliable as its outcomes, therefore the careful and systematic selection of outcome measures is extremely important. Currently, the selection of outcome measures for clinical trials designed to evaluate new drugs in patients with mitochondrial disorders is inefficient and has not been addressed systematically. Given that meaningful data can be obtained only from trials in which outcomes are assessed using valid instruments, one should first focus on the validation of a set of selected instruments in the target population. The aim of this review is to systematically select a 'toolbox' of robust outcome measures that are relevant to all patients. METHOD: Using an extensive search of published literature, we systematically compiled a toolbox with outcome measures based on a primary search for possible instruments Subsequently, we reduced this toolbox using strict criteria that were adapted from the United States Food and Drug Administration. RESULTS: A toolbox with clinically relevant and psychometrically robust instruments for performing clinical research in children with mitochondrial disorders was compiled.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Neck pain is a significant health problem in modern society. There is evidence to suggest that neck muscle strength is reduced in patients with neck pain. This article provides a critical analysis of the research literature on the clinimetric properties of tests to measure neck muscle strength or endurance in patients with non-specific neck pain, which can be used in daily practice. METHODS: A computerised literature search was performed in the Medline, CINAHL and Embase databases from 1980 to January 2007. Two reviewers independently assessed the clinimetric properties of identified measurement methods, using a checklist of generally accepted criteria for reproducibility (inter- and intra-observer reliability and agreement), construct validity, responsiveness and feasibility. RESULTS: The search identified a total of 16 studies. The instruments or tests included were: muscle endurance tests for short neck flexors, craniocervical flexion test with an inflatable pressure biofeedback unit, manual muscle testing of neck musculature, dynamometry and functional lifting tests (the cervical progressive iso-inertial lifting evaluation (PILE) test and the timed weighted overhead test). All the articles included report information on the reproducibility of the tests. Acceptable intra- and inter-observer reliability was demonstrated for t enduranctest for short neck flexors and the cervical PILE test. Construct validity and responsiveness have hardly been documented for tests on muscle functioning. CONCLUSION: The endurance test of the short neck flexors and the cervical PILE test can be regarded as appropriate instruments for measuring different aspects of neck muscle function in patients with non-specific neck pain.

Studies on the impact of chronic venous disease on quality of life are scarce compared to quality of life research in other diseases. The purpose of this paper was to describe instruments that assess the quality of life in patients with chronic venous disease and to review the literature on this topic. A computer search of the MedLine database was performed to identify papers; the bibliographies of relevant articles were reviewed to obtain additional papers. Papers were included if they described the development or use of a quality of life instrument for patients with chronic venous disease. A total of 25 papers were identified that fit the inclusion criteria. The studies described in the papers used six different generic instruments and ten disease-specific instruments. Quality of life in chronic venous disease was assessed in 12 studies. Six studies compared different types of treatment for chronic venous disease where QOL was an outcome measure. Despite the wide variety of measures used, results indicate that the quality of life of patients with chronic venous disease is affected in the physical domain mostly with regard to pain, physical functioning and mobility, and that they suffer from negative emotional reactions and social isolation.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To critically appraise the suitability of current quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaires for psoriasis research. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches of 5 bibliographic databases. QUESTIONNAIRE SELECTION: Predefined criteria were used to identify QOL questionnaires in dermatologic studies. Two investigators independently assessed and agreed on multidimensional generic, dermatology-specific, and psoriasis-specific QOL questionnaires for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted on the internal structure, reliability, and validity of the included questionnaires. DATA SYNTHESIS: Three generic, 3 dermatology-specific, and none of the psoriasis-specific questionnaires met the inclusion criteria: the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), the Dermatology Quality of Life Scales (DQOLS), the Dermatology-Specific Quality of Life Instrument (DSQL), and the Skindex-29. The generic NHP, SF-36 and SIP are well established, reliable, and valid. Although the data are not conclusive, the SF-36 was useful to assess effects of psoriasis on its component scales. The dermatology-specific DQOLS, DSQL, and Skindex-29 are relatively new and, therefore, less widely tested. Available psychometric data demonstrated the reliability and validity of all 3 dermatology-specific questionnaires. The Skindex-29 was also useful to assess change. CONCLUSIONS: None of the identified psoriasis-specific questionnaires met the inclusion criteria. Data on the suitability of the included questionnaires for psoriasis research were relatively sparse. The included generic questionnaires allow comparisons with nondermatologic diseases but do not allow assessment of relevant dermatology-specific aspects and are not sensitive to subtle effects of psoriasis on QOL. On the basis of the psychometric data of the present review, we find the Skindex-29 to be the most valuable dermatology-specific questionnaire for psoriasis research. Combination of the Skindex-29 with the generic SF-36 combines the merits of both types of questionnaires and we therefore recommend this combination.], accnum: %q[12224984], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["De Korte, J.", "Mombers, F.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Patient satisfaction and improved quality of life are the predominant considerations determining success in cosmetic surgery. However, few studies have examined patients' perceptions of their appearance following cosmetic facial surgery and/or nonsurgical facial rejuvenation. This study identified patient-reported outcome measures developed and validated for use in patients undergoing surgical and/or nonsurgical cosmetic procedures. METHODS: A systematic review of the English-language literature was performed. Patient-reported outcome measures designed to assess patient satisfaction and/or quality of life following surgical and/or nonsurgical cosmetic procedures were identified. Qualifying instruments were assessed for content and adherence to international guidelines for development and validation. RESULTS: From 442 articles, 47 patient-reported outcome measures assessing facial appearance after a cosmetic procedure were identified. Only nine questionnaires satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria. These measures were subdivided into the following categories: rhinoplasty (Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation, Glasgow Benefit Inventory, Facial Appearance Sorting Test), skin rejuvenation (Facial Lines Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, Skin Rejuvenation Outcomes Evaluation, Facial Lines Outcomes Questionnaire), face lift (Facelift Outcomes Evaluation), blepharoplasty (Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation), and general appearance (Derriford Appearance Scale 59). None of these measures satisfied all guidelines. All measures were limited by either their development, their validation, or their content. CONCLUSIONS: Valid, reliable, and responsive instruments designed to measure patient-reported outcomes following surgical and nonsurgical facial rejuvenation are lacking.

Depression instruments developed for use in depressed patients may not discriminate depressive symptoms from negative psychotic symptoms. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed depression instruments on their reliability and validity in patients with schizophrenia. METHODOLOGY: A systematic literature search was carried out in three electronic databases. Psychometric properties were extracted for those instruments of which reliability, divergent, concurrent and predictive validity were reported in one or more publications. RESULTS: Forty-eight publications described the reliability and validity of six depression instruments in patients with schizophrenia. The only self-report was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Depression subscale (BPRS-D), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Depression subscale (PANSS-D), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) were clinician rated. All instruments were reliable for the measurement of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The CDSS most accurately differentiated depressive symptoms from other symptoms of schizophrenia (divergent validity), correlated well with other depression instruments (concurrent validity), and was least likely to miss cases of depression or misdiagnose depression (predictive validity).

AIM: To critically assess HRQOL instruments used in studies of testosterone deficiency syndrome (TDS) to see whether they accurately measure these concerns. METHODS: A systematic review identified published articles. Studies were included if the population was adult men with TDS, with or without comorbid disease; used one or more HRQOL tools; and described the impact of treatment, the impact of TDS on the patient or the development of a questionnaire. Measurement properties and their use in clinical studies were described. Each study was assessed against 10 clinical face validity criteria to evaluate whether the questionnaires reflected issues that were of concern to patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Review of published literature. RESULTS: The study identified 29 articles that included 14 HRQOL questionnaires selected for use in 20 intervention studies, seven studies of the impact of TDS on the patient, and two studies describing the development of a HRQOL tool. Questionnaires displayed variable measurement properties and only nine studies complied with more than 50% of the clinical face validity criteria. Disease-specific instruments achieved a higher rate of compliance and more often demonstrated a positive effect of treatment on HRQOL compared to generic instruments. CONCLUSION: Instruments used to measure HRQOL display variable measurement properties and often lack adequate clinical face validity. There are well-validated disease-specific HRQOL measures for age-related TDS, but none for classical TDS patients. Clinical and political decision-makers require HRQOL information using a combination of well-validated generic questionnaires and patient-focused, disease specific instruments relevant to the target TDS population under study.], accnum: %q[19090941], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Langham, S.", "Maggi, M.", "Schulman, C.", "Quinton, R.", "Uhl-Hochgraeber, K."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases and related symptoms"], doi: %q[10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.01015.x], endnum: %q[211], fs: [], ghp: ["Health-related quality of life"], id: 232, instrument: [], issn: %q[1743-6109 (Electronic)], issue: %q[12], journal: %q[J Sex Med], oql: [], pnp: ["Patient Reported Outcome"], pubyear: %q[2008], ss: [], startpage: %q[2842-52], status: %q[published], title: %q[Health-related quality of life instruments in studies of adult men with testosterone deficiency syndrome: a critical assessment], tmi: ["1 - Questionnaires", "6 - Clinical rating scales"], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19090941"])

Traditional psychometric measures of cognitive abilities may not adequately reflect older adults' functioning in a real everyday context. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review on instruments available for evaluating the everyday problem-solving or everyday competence of the elderly with cognitive impairment and to critically review the measurement properties of the identified instruments. METHODS: We searched the databases such as Cinahl, Medline, PsycINFO, AARP Ageline, ProQuest and the Cochrane Library for the time period between January 1995 and December 2010. Reference lists of the included papers were also manually searched. RESULTS: Five instruments were included. All the instruments focused their framework on Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) domains which meet well with suggestions from other studies on the importance of IADL in determining an elderly individual's capability to live independently in the community. No available instruments for the moderate to severe impairment group were identified under this review.

Record.create(abstract: %q[In the quest to maximize average propulsive stroke impulses over 2000-m racing, testing and training of various strength parameters have been incorporated into the physical conditioning plans of rowers. Thus, the purpose of this review was 2-fold: to identify strength tests that were reliable and valid correlates (predictors) of rowing performance; and, to establish the benefits gained when strength training was integrated into the physical preparation plans of rowers. The reliability of maximal strength and power tests involving leg extension (e.g. leg pressing) and arm pulling (e.g. prone bench pull) was high (intra-class correlations 0.82-0.99), revealing that elite rowers were significantly stronger than their less competitive peers. The greater strength of elite rowers was in part attributed to the correlation between strength and greater lean body mass (r = 0.57-0.63). Dynamic lower body strength tests that determined the maximal external load for a one-repetition maximum (1RM) leg press (kg), isokinetic leg extension peak force (N) or leg press peak power (W) proved to be moderately to strongly associated with 2000-m ergometer times (r = -0.54 to -0.68; p < 0.05). Repetition tests that assess muscular or strength endurance by quantifying the number of repetitions accrued at a fixed percentage of the strength maximum (e.g. 50-70% 1RM leg press) or set absolute load (e.g. 40 kg prone bench pulls) were less reliable and more time consuming when compared with briefer maximal strength tests. Only leg press repetition tests were correlated with 2000-m ergometer times (e.g. r = -0.67; p < 0.05). However, these tests differentiate training experience and muscle morphology, in that those individuals with greater training experience and/or proportions of slow twitch fibres performed more repetitions. Muscle balance ratios derived from strength data (e.g. hamstring-quadriceps ratio <45% or knee extensor-elbow flexor ratio around 4.2 +/- 0.22 to 1) appeared useful in the pathological assessment of low back pain or rib injury history associated with rowing. While strength partially explained variances in 2000-m ergometer performance, concurrent endurance training may be counterproductive to strength development over the shorter term (i.e. <12 weeks). Therefore, prioritization of strength training within the sequence of training units should be considered, particularly over the non-competition phase (e.g. 2-6 sets x 4-12 repetitions, three sessions a week). Maximal strength was sustained when infrequent (e.g. one or two sessions a week) but intense (e.g. 73-79% of maximum) strength training units were scheduled; however, it was unclear whether training adaptations should emphasize maximal strength, endurance or power in order to enhance performance during the competition phase. Additionally, specific on-water strength training practices such as towing ropes had not been reported. Further research should examine the on-water benefits associated with various strength training protocols, in the context of the training phase, weight division, experience and level of rower, if limitations to the reliability and precision of performance data (e.g. 2000-m time or rank) can be controlled. In conclusion, while positive ergometer time-trial benefits of clinical and practical significance were reported with strength training, a lack of statistical significance was noted, primarily due to an absence of quality long-term controlled experimental research designs.], accnum: %q[21510717], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)"], author: ["Lawton, T.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Cough is a common symptom for which patients often seek medical advice and consume vast amounts of drugs. It is a real challenge for both the physician and the clinical researcher to evaluate a cough's clinical importance and its precise response to treatment. OBJECTIVES: This systematic literature review has the following objectives: first, to make an inventory of the validated tools for assessing cough, and second, to investigate the extent to which the results of various assessment methods can be correlated. METHODS: Two independent investigators searched the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for validation studies on cough assessment tools. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were included. Several ambulatory cough monitors automatically identify cough and have been validated in a limited number of patients. Three cough-specific quality-of-life scales (Leicester Cough Questionnaire, Cough Quality of Life Questionnaire, and Burden of Cough Questionnaire) have been validated. No validation studies of descriptive scores or visual analogue scales were found. The correlations between quality-of-life scores and cough frequency were good. The correlations between descriptive scores or visual analogue scales and more objective methods, such as cough frequency monitoring or quality-of-life scores, were inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Cough-specific quality-of-life questionnaires can provide valid outcomes for research into cough.

However, the assessment of patient satisfaction and quality of life (QOL) is also important. These outcomes are best assessed by patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments. OBJECTIVES: We sought to conduct a systematic review of published PRO instruments purporting to measure aspects associated with QOL and/or patient satisfaction in the dermatologic BCC/SCC population and evaluate their development, content, and psychometric properties. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane via Wiley, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and HaPI from inception to April 2011 were searched. Articles that discussed the instrument development and validation process were included. RESULTS: A total of 2212 articles were identified. Twenty met our inclusion criteria resulting in 6 PRO instruments: 3 general dermatology (Skindex, Dermatology Life Quality Index, dermatology quality of life scales), 1 general plastic surgery (Patient Outcomes of Surgery-Head/Neck), and 2 skin cancer-specific (Skin Cancer Index, disease-specific questionnaire). The 6 instruments all underwent some degree of formal development and validation, however, only the Skin Cancer Index was developed and validated in the BCC/SCC population. LIMITATIONS: The review may not have included all relevant PRO instruments. CONCLUSIONS: The Skin Cancer Index demonstrates the most evidence of its usefulness in patients with BCC/SCC. The Skindex-16, Dermatology QOL Scales, and Dermatology Life Quality Index target different aspects of QOL and should be used depending on the specific question being investigated.

Standardized criteria, extended with levels of evidence, were applied to assess the quality of the clinimetric studies and the properties (i.e., reliability, validity, and responsiveness) of the described instruments. RESULTS: A variety of measurement instruments were identified. Only 16 instruments have been studied for their measurement properties in RA patients: 7 for assessing foot function, 3 for measuring foot-related disability, and 6 for measuring both foot pain and foot-related disability. Thirteen instruments were rated for reliability, of which 10 were rated positively on different levels of evidence. No positive rating for absolute measurement error was applicable for any of the tests. Internal consistency was reported for 7 instruments; 3 assigned a positive rating. For 2 instruments, Rasch analysis was used to assess the methodologic quality. A positive rating was reported for goodness-of-fit only, not for item calibration. Seven instruments were rated for construct validity, and 3 assigned a positive rating. Only 2 instruments were rated positively for responsiveness.

Anxiety is associated with increased subjective motor symptoms, more severe gait problems, dyskinesias, freezing, and on/off fluctuations. Anxiety has a negative impact on health related quality of life and is strongly associated with depressive syndromes. Since a variety of anxiety scales have been used in PD patients, the Movement Disorder Society commissioned a task force to assess the clinimetric properties of these scales in PD. A systematic review was conducted to identify anxiety scales that have either been validated or used in patients with PD. Six anxiety rating scales were identified. These were the Beck anxiety inventory, the hospital anxiety and depression scale, the Zung self-rating anxiety scale and anxiety status inventory, the Spielberger state trait anxiety inventory, and the Hamilton anxiety rating scale. In addition, Item 5 (anxiety) of the neuropsychiatric inventory was included in the review. No scales met the criteria to be "recommended," and all scales were classified as "suggested." Essential clinimetric information is missing for all scales. Because several scales exist and have been used in PD, the task force recommends further studies of these instruments.

Record.create(abstract: %q[CONTEXT: Symptoms suggestive of acute sinusitis are a common reason for patients to visit primary care providers. Since objective measures of outcome have not been shown to be related to patient reported outcomes, measures of treatment success have focused on symptom relief and improved health-related quality of life (HRQL). Assessing the appropriate role of treatment - for example, antibiotics for patients with acute sinusitis - requires valid, reliable, and responsive measures of outcome. We identified symptom scores and HRQL instruments for adults with sinusitis and assessed their performance characteristics. DATA SOURCES: Articles identified through computer searches of the medline, premedline, and embase databases, the Cochrane Library, and internet documents; inquiries to experts in sinusitis and outcomes assessment; and review of reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that used HRQL instruments or evaluated the performance characteristics of symptom scores in adults with sinusitis, published in English after 1966. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, setting, and patient characteristics; instrument length and format; and instrument validity, reliability, responsiveness to change, and interpretability. Study quality was assessed using a 10-point score. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 1,340 articles in the original search, 29 articles using 16 HRQL instruments and 5 symptoms scores met inclusion and exclusion criteria. The overall quality of these studies was low; only 4 studies scored higher than 4 of 10 points. Four studies included patients with acute sinusitis, but only 2 included exclusively acute sinusitis patients. Three instruments have been shown to meet basic requirements for validity, reliability, and responsiveness: the Chronic Sinusitis Survey, the Rhinosinusitis Outcome Measure-31, and the Sinonasal Outcome Test-16. No instrument has been validated in a primary care setting or for patients with acute sinusitis. CONCLUSIONS: Few validated measures of sinusitis-specific HRQL are available. The 3 instruments shown to be valid, reliable, and responsive have been assessed in patients with chronic sinusitis. No measure has been validated in primary care settings or for patients with acute sinusitis. A lack of valid, responsive outcome measures may limit current treatment recommendations for patients with acute sinusitis.], accnum: %q[12795739], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Linder, J.

METHODS: Articles were retrieved from PubMed. Inclusion criteria were written in English, published up to December 2008 and describing instruments evaluated in more than one study. Search terms were pressure ulcer, wound healing, severity of illness index, reproducibility of results, sensitivity and specificity. Articles describing pressure ulcer staging scales and articles not describing clinimetric properties of an instrument were excluded. Validity, reliability, responsiveness and feasibility for routine clinical use were described of all instruments evaluated in two or more studies. RESULTS: Eleven instruments were described. Clinimetric information was incomplete for all instruments. Clinimetric information was most complete and promising for two instruments: 'ruler length and width' and the 'Sessing' scale. The ruler method showed good intra-rater and inter-rater reliability and good concurrent validity. The 'Sessing' scale has a moderate concurrent validity but was not tested for its responsiveness.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Objectives: To examine the validity of low-tech procedures used in routine clinical practice to determine the range of movement of the lumbar spine in comparison to the 'gold' standard of measurement. Data sources: AMED, CINAHL, Embase, OVID Medline, The Cochrane Library, Spine and other relevant journals. Review methods: A search of electronic databases (January 2006) was complemented by hand searching reference lists of identified studies and journals, plus consultation with recognised experts to identify English language studies designed to evaluate the validity of low-tech procedures used to determine range of movement of the lumbar spine in adult human subjects presenting with non-specific low back pain. Results: Four relevant studies were identified for analysis. Three studies investigated the use of the double-inclinometer method and one study investigated the modified-modified Schober test. The appraisal was performed using the modified QUADAS tool. The studies were considered heterogeneous and thus qualitative analysis was undertaken. This indicated limited positive evidence that the double-inclinometer method is valid for measuring total lumbar range of movement, conflicting evidence for double-inclinometer measurement of lumbar flexion range, limited evidence that the modified-modified Schober test is not valid for measurement of lumbar flexion range and limited evidence that the double-inclinometer method is not valid for measuring lumbar extension range. Conclusion: There is little evidence to support the use of current methods of range of movement measurement in the lumbar spine. If range of movement is to continue to be used during routine clinical practice to assess spinal function, degree of impairment and response to therapeutic input there is a need for scientific evidence on the validity of these procedures.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to systematically review the content and clinimetric evidence (rigor of rating scales and indexes for the description of clinical phenomena) of published patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments used to assess femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and labral hip pathology. METHODS: We used Medical Subject Heading terms related to FAI and labrum/labral tears to search the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for studies of FAI and labral hip pathology. Studies with hip-related PRO instruments, with any operative intervention except total hip arthroplasty, were included. We excluded studies with a skeletally immature population, revision surgeries in more than 10% of cases, or a primary diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis. We conducted a second review using the same databases for studies reporting clinimetric properties of at least 1 of the PRO instruments identified previously. Articles were selected in an independent, stepwise manner by 2 reviewers. Selected articles were evaluated to determine the presence and quality of measurement properties of the outcome instruments. RESULTS: We found 5 articles assessing 3 PRO instruments: the Hip Outcome Score (HOS), the Non-Arthritic Hip Score, and the 12-item modified Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The HOS had the highest positive rating for internal consistency, construct validity, agreement, responsiveness, lack of floor/ceiling effect, and interpretability. The Non-Arthritic Hip Score showed evidence for validity and lack of floor/ceiling effect. The modified Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index was only strong for internal consistency and was indeterminate for construct validity. CONCLUSIONS: Only 3 PRO instruments have shown clinimetric evidence to support their use to measure outcomes in FAI and labral pathology patients. The HOS has the greatest amount of clinimetric evidence and is the most proven instrument for use in this population.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The objective of this review was to identify health-related workplace productivity loss survey instruments, with particular emphasis on those that capture a metric suitable for direct translation into a monetary figure. A literature search using Medline, HealthSTAR, PsycINFO and Econlit databases between 1966 and 2002, and a telephone-administered survey of business leaders and researchers, were conducted to identify health-related workplace productivity measurement survey instruments. This review was conducted from the societal perspective. Each identified instrument was reviewed for the following: (i). reliability; (ii). content validity; (iii). construct validity; (iv). criterion validity; (v). productivity metric(s); (vi). instrument scoring technique; (vii). suitability for direct translation into a monetary figure; (viii). number of items; (ix). mode(s) of administration; and (x). disease state(s) in which it had been tested. Reliability and validity testing have been performed for 8 of the 11 identified surveys. Of the 11 instruments identified, six captured metrics that are suitable for direct translation into a monetary figure. Of those six, one instrument measured absenteeism, while the other five measured both absenteeism and presenteeism. All of the identified instruments except for one were available as paper, self-administered questionnaires and many were available in languages other than English.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: Whenever a new scale is created or translated from another language, it must be validated, establishing its reliability for the new population where it will be used. Sleep quality concept is a construct that can be evaluated using self-report scales. Resulting elements vary depending on the individuals surveyed. This type of evaluation is mainly subjective and includes quantitative aspects such as sleep duration, number of awakenings, latency time, and qualitative aspects such as rest sensation, mood and oneiric content (Valencia, 2000). In the present study we made a critical review of the sleep scales designed for child, adolescent and adult populations that have been validated and the difficulties they might present. METHODOLOGY: Between September 2005 and May 2006 a bibliographical search was made within Pubmed, Ovid and the data base of the periodical and book library of the Ramon de la Fuente Muniz National Institute of Psychiatry, using and combining the following key words: sleep, sleep questionnaire, sleep scale, sleep inventory, adolescent, adolescent sleep scale. The most relevant papers to our study were selected. The search was limited to Spanish and English articles, although there was no year or geographical origin limit. Articles that did not include clinimetrical data where excluded.

METHODS: A systematic review of published studies on the measurement properties of rotator cuff questionnaires was performed. Two investigators independently rated the quality of the studies using the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments checklist. This checklist was developed in an international Delphi consensus study. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included, in which two measurement instruments were evaluated, namely the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index and the Rotator Cuff Quality-of-Life Measure. The methodological quality of the included studies was adequate on some properties (construct validity, reliability, responsiveness, internal consistency, and translation) but need to be improved on other aspects. The most important methodological aspects that need to be developed are as follows: measurement error, content validity, structural validity, cross-cultural validity, criterion validity, and interpretability.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to inform choice of optimal patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of anxiety, depression and general distress for studies evaluating psychosocial interventions for English-speaking adults with heterogenous cancer diagnoses. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify all PROMs used to assess anxiety, depression and general distress in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychosocial interventions for people with cancer published between 1999 and May 2009. Candidate PROMs were evaluated for content, evidence of reliability and validity, clinical meaningfulness, comparison data, efficiency, ease of administration, cognitive burden and track record in identifying treatment effects in RCTs of psychosocial interventions. Property ratings were weighted and summed to give an overall score out of 100. RESULTS: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scored highest overall (weighted score = 77.5), followed by the unofficial short-form of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the POMS-37 (weighted score = 60), and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and original POMS (weighted score = 55 each). CONCLUSIONS: The HADS' efficiency and substantial track record recommend its use where anxiety, mixed affective disorders or general distress are outcomes of interest. However, continuing controversy concerning the HADS depression scale cautions against dependence where depressive disorders are of primary interest. Where cost is a concern, the POMS-37 is recommended to measure anxiety or mixed affective disorders but does not offer a suitable index of general distress and, like the HADS, emphasises anhedonia in measuring depression. Where depression is the sole focus, the CES-D is recommended.], accnum: %q[20596731], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Luckett, T.", "Butow, P.

DESIGN: Systematic literature search for instruments designed to measure fear of pain in patients with persistent musculoskeletal pain. Psychometric properties were evaluated by adjusted Wind criteria. RESULTS: Five questionnaires (Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), Fear-Avoidance of Pain Scale (FAPS), Fear of Pain Questionnaire (FPQ), Pain and Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS), and the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)) were included in the review. The main findings were that for most questionnaires, there was no underlying conceptual model to support the questionnaire's construct. Psychometric properties were evaluated by diverse methods, which complicated comparisons of different versions of the same questionnaires. Construct validity and responsiveness was generally not supported and/or untested. CONCLUSION: The weak construct validity implies that no measure can currently identify who is fearful. The lack of evidence for responsiveness restricts the current use of the instruments to identify clinically relevant change from treatment.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Type 2 diabetes has significant adverse effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A vast array of questionnaires has been used to measure HRQoL in diabetes patients, contributing to the difficulty of selecting instruments for future research. To systematically evaluate these measures, a literature search was undertaken to identify relevant publications. This paper summarizes the generic, diabetes-specific, and psychological measures utilized to evaluate persons with type 2 diabetes, and highlights related findings. Generic instruments demonstrate significant reductions in health status compared with other chronic disease populations and healthy controls. Multiple diabetes-specific measures are available to assess domains affected by the disease, including symptoms, worries, self-care, locus of control, functional ability, social support, and sexual functioning. Psychological measures show that type 2 diabetes is frequently associated with adverse psychological effects, particularly depression. Since much of this research has been cross-sectional in nature, little is known about responsiveness of many of the HRQoL measures to clinical change and treatment effects. It is clear that HRQoL results are influenced by multiple patient and disease factors, particularly age, gender, and the presence and severity of disease complications and comorbid conditions. These factors should be considered in the design and analysis of HRQoL evaluations in type 2 diabetes patients. Selection of instruments for future research will therefore require careful evaluation of study design and objectives, population characteristics, the presence of disease-related factors, and outcomes of interest.], accnum: %q[16464206], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Luscombe, F.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To report an evidence-based review of participation instruments that have been used in spinal cord injury (SCI) clinical practice and research. METHODS: Rehabilitation literature was searched for instruments used by at least 2 independent SCI researchers since 2000. Each instrument was reviewed by 2 committee members. One person reviewed the scale and documented the level of use and psychometric properties. The second committee member verified the values and made suggestions for changes. RESULTS: Three instruments met the review criteria: Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART), Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE-H), and the Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA). Each instrument incorporates different perspectives in the measurement of participation. The LIFE-H uses a qualitative approach, whereas the CHART adopts a quantitative approach; both are based on societal norms of participation. In contrast, the IPA integrates individual choice and control in defining participation. CHART is the most widely used instrument, although its development predates the development of the ICF. The IPA is a relatively new instrument, and its psychometric properties have only recently published. CONCLUSIONS: Continuing research is needed to develop conceptually and psychometric valid measures of participation for use with people with SCI. Priorities include understanding the relationship between objective and subjective indicators of participation, describing the dimensions of participation, and identifying appropriate measurement models and psychometric approaches to evaluate the nonhierarchical character of participation.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: To identify and appraise all studies relating to and instruments developed to measure quality of life (QOL) in children with gastrointestinal or liver diseases. METHODS: A literature search was undertaken using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO to identify relevant articles published up to the end of 2005. These were reviewed by both authors and data were extracted using a standardised form. Articles were excluded if no attempt was made to measure QOL, they did not relate to children ages <17 years, they did not relate to gastrointestinal or liver diseases, or they were review articles. Quality of life instruments identified were rated according to proposed criteria. RESULTS: From a total of 2379 articles identified in the initial search, a total of 2309 were excluded, leaving 70 included studies. These were assigned to the following categories: inflammatory bowel disease, n = 17; cystic fibrosis, n = 20; liver disease, n = 11; surgery, n = 15; and miscellaneous, n = 7. These studies describe the impact that these diseases have on the QOL of affected children. A total of 11 disease-specific QOL instruments and 1 generic instrument with a chronic disease module were identified, but only 5 of these fulfilled the proposed quality criteria and can be recommended for future use. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic gastrointestinal and liver diseases can have an enormous effect on the QOL of affected individuals and their families. A number of disease-specific paediatric QOL instruments have been developed and validated.

The aim of this review was to identify PCOS-specific QoL measures and establish whether their development history and measurement properties support their use in clinical trials. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using terms synonymous with "PCOS" and "QoL." Following identification of measures, further searches were undertaken using the questionnaire name and abbreviation to explore its use, development history, and demonstrated measurement properties. RESULTS: Of 56 abstracts screened, 21 reported using PRO measures. One PCOS-specific QoL measure was identified: the PolyCystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire (PCOSQ). Nine papers show that the PCOSQ's development history is somewhat incomplete, and that it does not have good content validity. The PCOSQ subscales demonstrate acceptable levels of reliability (0.70-0.97) and partial known-groups validity as well as convergent/divergent validity with other PRO instruments.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To compare and contrast disease-specific quality of life instruments in Parkinson's disease and assess their clinimetric properties. METHODS: Two reviewers independently evaluated both thoroughness and results of studies regarding clinimetric characteristics of identified scales. RESULTS: Twenty studies were found reporting on the clinimetric properties of four scales. The content validity of the Parkinson's disease questionnaire-39 item version (PDQ-39), the Parkinson's disease quality of life questionnaire (PDQL), and the "Fragebogen Parkinson LebensQualitat" (Parkinson Quality of Life questionnaire; PLQ) was adequate to good, but for the Parkinson's impact scale (PIMS) it was insufficient. Construct validity of both the PDQ-39 and the PDQL was good, but for the PLQ and the PIMS this was insufficiently evaluated. Internal consistency of all scale totals and of subscale totals of the PDQL were good, whereas for the social support subscale of the PDQ-39 and four subscales of the PLQ this was inadequate. Test-retest reliability was not evaluated for the PDQL and was adequate in the other scales. Responsiveness was partially established for the PDQ-39, and not assessed for the other scales. The number of available translations, as well as the number of studies in which these instruments were used, differed considerably. CONCLUSIONS: The selection of an instrument partially depends on the goal of the study. In many situations however, the PDQ-39 will probably be the most appropriate HRQoL instrument.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: To review the performance characteristics of the instruments most commonly used to measure clinical outcomes in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), including global assessments, articular indices, functional/disability assessments, and quality-of-life measures. METHODS: As part of an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comparative effectiveness review of antirheumatic drugs, we explored the characteristics of commonly used outcome measures for JIA. English-language studies of children with JIA were identified from MEDLINE(R) and EMBASE(R). Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, with subsequent full text review of studies selected based on predetermined criteria. RESULTS: We included 35 publications describing 34 unique studies and involving 14,831 patients. The Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) was the most extensively studied instrument and had high reliability, but only moderate correlations with other indices of disease activity and poor responsiveness to change in disease status. The physician global assessment of disease activity (PGA) and articular indices had the strongest association with disease activity and were most responsive to change. Measures of psychosocial function and quality of life were moderately associated with measures of disease activity, but less responsive to changes in disease status. CONCLUSIONS: In children with JIA, no single instrument was superior in reliability or validity or in describing the impact of JIA. Although the CHAQ has been extensively evaluated, the PGA and articular indices appear to have the highest responsiveness to change and therefore the highest potential for detecting important differences in treatment response.

DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING: Original articles that used at least one PBOM and were conducted within a population of women with AUB. PATIENT(S): Women with AUB. INTERVENTION(S): The titles, abstracts, and studies were systematically reviewed for eligibility. The PBOMs used in eligible studies were summarized. Essential psychometric properties were identified, and a list of criteria for each property was generated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): "Quality" of individual PBOMs as determined using the listed criteria for psychometric properties. RESULT(S): Nine hundred eighty-three studies referenced AUB and patient-reported outcomes. Of these, 80 studies met the eligibility criteria. Fifty different instruments were used to evaluate amount of bleeding, bleeding-related symptoms, or menstrual bleeding-specific quality of life. The quality of each of these instruments was evaluated on eight psychometric properties. The majority of instruments had no documentation of reliability, precision, or feasibility. There was no satisfactory evidence that any one instrument completely addressed all eight psychometric properties.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Constipation is a subjective phenomenon, and as such must be evaluated using patient self-report. Valid and reliable measures of constipation are essential to standardize the diagnosis, assess the severity and evaluate the effectiveness of treatments. AIM: To compare and contrast published self-report measures of constipation in terms of development, content, general characteristics, psychometric properties and clinical utility. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966-2007), CINAHL (1980-2007), Cochrane (1993-2007) and Web of Science (1995-2007) were searched to identify self-report measures of constipation. Measures of constipation were selected if they: (i) were self-report measures that measured only constipation; (ii) had undergone psychometric testing; (iii) were used in adults and (iv) were written in English. RESULTS: Seven self-report measures of constipation were identified. The content areas evaluated by these measures varied. Only two measures had adequate validity and reliability, sensitivity to change, or were tested in more than one sample.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Cough is the most common complaint for patients seeking medical attention in the United States. Although the most common cause of cough is acute self-limited viral infections, chronic cough (cough that lasts more than 4 weeks in children <14 years of age or more than 8 weeks in adolescents and adults) has a significant impact on quality of life and is responsible for up to 38 percent of pulmonary outpatient visits. Furthermore, a treatable cause is absent in up to 46 percent of patients with chronic cough despite a thorough diagnostic investigation. The comparative value of tools for assessing cough and the comparative effectiveness of treatments for unexplained or refractory cough are uncertain. We searched PubMed(R), Embase(R), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (June 4, 2012) for relevant English-language comparative studies. Two investigators screened each abstract and full-text article for inclusion, abstracted data, rated quality and applicability, and graded evidence. Random-effects models were used to compute summary estimates of effects. We supplemented the meta-analysis of direct comparisons with a mixed treatment meta-analysis that incorporated data from placebo comparisons and head-to-head comparisons. To evaluate instruments for assessing cough, we considered the dimensions of cough frequency, cough severity, and cough-specific quality of life (QOL). We sought to measure the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of various instruments used to assess each of these dimensions. Seventy-eight studies (5,927 subjects) evaluated instruments for assessing cough. The Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and Cough-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ) were the most widely studied instruments in adults; there is moderate strength of evidence (SOE) to support both the LCQ's and the CQLQ's validity in assessing severity/QOL of cough. For pediatric populations, there is moderate SOE to support the Parent Cough-specific Quality of Life questionnaire's (PC-QOL) validity in assessing severity/QOL of cough. Electronic recording devices are accurate for assessing cough frequency, but show variable correlation with other tools. Although visual analog scales (VAS) are easy to administer and have face validity, we did not identify any studies to formally validate their accuracy in assessing cough. We identified no studies exploring the impact of cough assessment instruments on therapeutic efficacy or patient outcome efficacy. Forty-eight studies (2,923 patients) evaluated 67 therapeutic comparisons for patients with chronic cough. Classes of drugs evaluated included opioid, anesthetic, and nonopioid/nonanesthetic antitussives; expectorant and mucolytic protussives; antihistamines; antibiotics; inhaled corticosteroids; and inhaled anticholinergics. The opioid and certain nonopioid/nonanesthetic antitussives most frequently demonstrated efficacy for managing chronic cough in adults. In particular, codeine and dextromethorphan reduced cough severity and frequency. Relative to placebo, the effect of dextromethorphan on cough severity was 0.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.80; p=0.0008), and the effect of opiates was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.86; p<0.0001). Relative to placebo, the effect of dextromethorphan on cough frequency was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.85; p=0.0248), and the effect of codeine was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.91; p=0.0260). However, due to inconsistency and imprecision of results, and small numbers of direct comparisons, the overall SOE is insufficient to draw firm conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of these agents. Very few studies evaluated nonpharmacological therapies (two studies) or the management of cough in children (three studies). Several instruments for assessing cough severity, frequency, and impact on cough-specific quality of life show good internal consistency but variable correlation with other cough measurement tools, meaning that a number of instruments are precise but their accuracy is less clear. Although the evidence is sparse, the opioid and certain nonopioid/nonanesthetic antitussives most frequently demonstrated efficacy for managing the symptom of chronic cough in adults. Our review highlights the need for further studies in patient populations with unexplained or refractory chronic cough as determined by current diagnostic and empiric treatment recommendations. Further, it shows the need for more systematic design and reporting of these studies and assessment of their patient-centered outcomes.

Record.create(abstract: %q[A variety of measures are currently used to assess psychosocial outcome (quality of life) in cardiac rehabilitation programmes. However, there is no consensus on the most appropriate instruments to use. Instruments that are not sufficiently responsive to change in cardiac populations are unsuitable as audit tools as they underrepresent the benefits of programme attendance. To identify the most responsive instruments in cardiac rehabilitation populations a systematic overview of studies for the 10-year period 1986-1995 was conducted. The following databases were searched: Medline, Psychlit, Cinahl and Sociofile and 32 relevant studies were identified. The effect size statistic (a comparison of the magnitude of change to the variability in baseline scores) was used to determine those instruments most responsive to change. The following instruments were identified as being responsive in more than one study: Beck Depression Inventory, Global Mood Scale, Health Complaints Checklist, Heart Patients Psychological Questionnaire and Speilberger State Anxiety Inventory. There is little consensus on psychosocial evaluation instrument use in the cardiac rehabilitation literature. A number of measures show significant potential for routine outcome assessment. Formal assessment of these instruments is recommended to inform final recommendations about instrument selection for audit and evaluation purposes in cardiac rehabilitation.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Research and screening of anxiety in the perinatal period is hampered by a lack of psychometric data on self-report anxiety measures used in perinatal populations. This paper aimed to review self-report measures that have been validated with perinatal women. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out of four electronic databases. Additional papers were obtained through searching identified articles. Thirty studies were identified that reported validation of an anxiety measure with perinatal women. RESULTS: Most commonly validated self-report measures were the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS). Of the 30 studies included, 11 used a clinical interview to provide criterion validity. Remaining studies reported one or more other forms of validity (factorial, discriminant, concurrent and predictive) or reliability. The STAI shows criterion, discriminant and predictive validity and may be most useful for research purposes as a specific measure of anxiety. The Kessler 10 (K-10) may be the best short screening measure due to its ability to differentiate anxiety disorders. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21) measures multiple types of distress, shows appropriate content, and remains to be validated against clinical interview in perinatal populations. LIMITATIONS: Nineteen studies did not report sensitivity or specificity data. The early stages of research into perinatal anxiety, the multitude of measures in use, and methodological differences restrict comparison of measures across studies. CONCLUSION: There is a need for further validation of self-report measures of anxiety in the perinatal period to enable accurate screening and detection of anxiety symptoms and disorders.], accnum: %q[21078523], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Meades, R.", "Ayers, S."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Mental and behavioural disorders and related symptoms"], doi: %q[10.1016/j.jad.2010.10.009], endnum: %q[393], fs: [], ghp: [], id: 283, instrument: [], issn: %q[1573-2517 (Electronic)], issue: %q[1-2], journal: %q[J Affect Disord], oql: [], pnp: ["Patient Reported Outcome", "Non-patient Reported Outcome"], pubyear: %q[2011], ss: ["Cognitive/mental state"], startpage: %q[1-15], status: %q[published], title: %q[Anxiety measures validated in perinatal populations: a systematic review], tmi: ["1 - Questionnaires", "6 - Clinical rating scales", "2 - Interviews"], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21078523"])
Record.create(abstract: %q[A sizable body of research has now examined the complex relationship between quality of life (QoL) and depressive disorder. Uptake of QoL research in relation to bipolar disorder (BD) has been comparatively slow, although increasing numbers of QoL studies are now being conducted in bipolar populations. We aimed to perform a review of studies addressing the assessment of generic and health-related QoL in patients with bipolar disorder. A literature search was conducted in a comprehensive selection of databases including MEDLINE up to November 2004. Key words included: bipolar disorder or manic-depression, mania, bipolar depression, bipolar spectrum and variants AND quality of life, health-related QoL, functional status, well-being and variants. Articles were included if they were published in English and reported on an assessment of generic or health-related QoL in patients with BD. Articles were not included if they had assessed fewer than 10 patients with BD, were only published in abstract form or only assessed single dimensions of functioning. The literature search initially yielded 790 articles or abstracts. Of these, 762 did not meet our inclusion criteria, leaving a final total of 28 articles. These were sub-divided into four categories (assessment of QoL in patients with BD at different stages of the disorder, comparisons of QoL in patients with BD with that of other patient populations, QoL instrument evaluation in patients with BD and treatment studies using QoL instruments to assess outcome in Patients with BD) and described in detail. The review indicated that there is growing interest in QoL research in bipolar populations. Although the scientific quality of the research identified was variable, increasing numbers of studies of good design are being conducted. The majority of the studies we identified indicated that QoL is markedly impaired in patients with BD, even when they are considered to be clinically euthymic. We identified several important avenues for future research, including a need for more assessment of QoL in hypo/manic patients, more longitudinal research and the development of a disease-specific measure of QoL for patients with BD.], accnum: %q[16288650], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Michalak, E.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: This study critically appraises the measurement properties of tools to measure muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in community-dwelling older people. This can support the selection of a valid and reliable set of tools that is feasible for future screening and identification of sarcopenia. METHODS: The databases PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Cochrane were systematically searched (January 11, 2012). Studies were included if they investigated the measurement properties or feasibility, or both, of tools to measure muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in community-dwelling older people aged >/=60 years. The consensus-based standards for the selection of health status measurement instruments (COSMIN) checklist was used for quality appraisal of the studies. RESULTS: Sixty-two publications were deemed eligible, including tools for muscle mass (n = 16), muscle strength (n = 15), and physical performance (n = 31). Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and a 4-compartment model were used as gold standards for muscle mass assessment. Other frequently used measures of muscle mass are dual-energy x-ray and the bioelectrical impedance (BIA); however, reliability data of the BIA are lacking. Handheld dynamometry and gait speed or a short physical performance battery provide a valid and reliable measurement of muscle strength and physical performance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that several tools are available for valid and reliable measurements of muscle mass, strength, and performance in clinical settings. For a home-setting BIA, handheld dynamometry and gait speed or a short physical performance battery are the most valid, reliable, and feasible.

These questionnaires can be a desirable method for documenting the status and progress of patients with chronic pain. Disability questionnaires were identified from searches of MEDLINE and PsychLIT from 1980 to 1995 and from bibliography reviews. Questionnaires were classified according to whether they evaluated disability in terms of health status, functional assessment, pain, or a specific condition (e.g., back pain, rheumatologic disorders, cancer, other). They were reviewed for conventional psychometric attributes of reliability and validity, in addition to feasibility. Most studies provide some evidence of construct validity for questionnaires, but there are widely differing content domains, suggesting that consensual definitions of pain-related disability have not been developed. It is difficult to establish criterion validity without defined standards of disability to calibrate questionnaire sensitivity. Normative data and information about feasibility are usually lacking.

METHODS: A literature search of MEDLINE and CINAHL through September 2008 was performed to gather articles on the reliability, validity, and utility of a wide variety of outcome measurements for neck pain. RESULTS: Different types of definitions appear in the literature based on anatomical location, etiology, severity, and duration of symptoms. Classifications according to severity and duration of pain and the establishment of selection criteria seem to play a crucial role in study designs and in clinical settings to ensure homogeneous groups and effective interventions. A series of objective tests and subjective self-report measures are useful in assessing physical abilities, pain, functional ability, psychosocial well-being, general health status, and quality of life in patients with neck pain. Self-administered questionnaires are commonly used in clinical practice and research projects.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: To review the number and characteristics of self-reported sleep measures used to evaluate impaired sleep/wakefulness in traumatic brain injury (TBI) populations. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive peer-reviewed literature search of Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and various bibliographies. Only standardized self-report measures for evaluating sleep dysfunction and its signs were taken into consideration. RESULTS: Sixteen self-report measures used in TBI research and clinical practices were identified. Five were generic, five symptom-related, and six were condition-specific measures. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index and Epworth sleepiness scale were partially validated in post-acute TBI. CONCLUSION: Although no instrument has been specifically developed for TBI patients, there are scientific benefits to using the existing measures. However, additional research is needed to examine their applicability to the TBI population. The design and introduction of a new instrument able to triage sleep-related complaints between depressive, other medical, and primary sleep disorders-with a section for caregiver reports-might assist in the identification of the etiology of sleep dysfunction in persons with TBI.

Record.create(abstract: %q[There is growing recognition of the need to consider the effect of mental health treatments on functional independence/abilities, in addition to any effects on primary symptoms. A variety of performance-based measures of functional living skills have appeared in the medical literature over the past 25 years in discipline-specific journals, but there has been little attempt to synthesize this information to guide mental health clinicians and researchers in choosing among the available measures. Thus, the goal of the present review was (1) to identify and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of currently available performance-based assessments of functional living skills for adult populations, and (2) to make specific recommendations regarding use of currently available instruments as well as recommendations for future instrument development. Through a comprehensive search of electronic citation databases for English-language articles on performance-based instruments, as well as via cross-referenced articles in the bibliography of each initially identified article, we identified 94 relevant articles covering 31 instruments, including 20 multi-domain instrument batteries, and 11 additional domain-specific performance-based instruments. Most identified instruments provided evidence of adequate reliability, but empirical data regarding the predictive validity of each scale in terms of actual "real world functioning" was less prevalent. Several good performance-based measures have been developed for individuals with dementia, psychiatric illnesses, and older healthy individuals. Future instrument development may benefit from a focus on brevity, empirical item selection as determined by patients/caregivers, predictive validity with an emphasis on change in functioning over time, and the relationship of performance to levels of competency required for the completion of everyday tasks.], accnum: %q[16360706], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Moore, D.

Method: Electronic searches of PubMed, EBSCO, Academic Search Premier, PsycINFO, CINAHL and online library catalogs were conducted using search terms including but not limited to 'fear of falling', 'falls efficacy', 'fall-related self-efficacy', 'balance confidence', 'fall-related psychological outcome(s)' and 'independent-living'. Results: Each of these constructs is unique, yet instruments are often employed to measure constructs other than those the instruments were designed to assess.

DATA COLLECTION: Relevant articles in English were retrieved through a search of MEDLINE and the Index to Chiropractic Literature. Key search terms were back muscle endurance, isometric back endurance, trunk extensors, back muscle performance, and Sorensen test. DATA SYNTHESIS: The principal criterion for inclusion was as follows: any study that discussed or tested an isometric type of back endurance extension test. Studies that were excluded did not use an isometric testing protocol. Thirty-seven of the initial studies are included in this review. RESULTS: Six different types of isometric back extension endurance testing methods were found. Three of these procedures require special testing devices. Much of the research on this topic has centered on a procedure known as the Sorensen test. Normative databases have been established for the Sorensen test and 2 other test types. Validity and reliability have been assessed for some of the procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of motivation and effort exerted by the subject are limiting factors in all of the tests reviewed.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: There is a need to measure children's 'activity performance and participation' as defined in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth (WHO ICF). The aim of this review is to identify instruments that are suitable for use in postal surveys with families of children with cerebral palsy. METHODS: We conducted a structured review of instruments that use child or family self-assessment of 'activity performance and participation'. The review involved a systematic search for instruments using multiple published sources. Appraisal of the instruments used the predefined criteria of appropriateness, validity, reliability, responsiveness, precision, interpretability, acceptability and feasibility. RESULTS: There are relatively few child or family assessed instruments appropriate for measuring children's activities and participation. Seven instruments were identified that could potentially be administered by mail. The Assessment of Life Habits for Children (LIFE-H) was the most appropriate instrument as assessed by its content but the reliability of child or family self-assessment is not known. If the LIFE-H were shown to be a reliable self-report measure then the LIFE-H would be the recommended choice. Currently, the Activities Scale for Kids and the condition-specific Lifestyle Assessment Questionnaire for cerebral palsy (LAQ-CP) provide the broadest description of what and how frequently children with cerebral palsy perform a range of activities and thereby indicate participation. The LAQ-CP also provides additional contextual information on the impact of any disability on the participation of the family unit. CONCLUSION: There remains much scope for developing valid and reliable self-assessed measures corresponding to the WHO ICF dimensions of activities and participation.], accnum: %q[15948876], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Morris, C.", "Kurinczuk, J.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: To use the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as a framework to identify and to evaluate wheelchair-specific outcome instruments that are useful for measuring activity and participation. DATA SOURCES: CINHAL, PsychInfo, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Dissertation Abstracts Medline databases, and conference proceedings. STUDY SELECTION: Activity and participation measures that were specifically intended for adults who use wheelchairs and that were published in English in a peer-reviewed journal were included in this review. Based on electronic database searches using a variety of search terms, articles were identified by title, and appropriate abstracts were retrieved. Articles were obtained for all relevant abstracts. For peer-reviewed measures included in the review, we obtained any instruction manuals and related publications, frequently published in conference proceedings and theses or available electronically, on the development and testing of the measure. DATA EXTRACTION: Tools included in the review were evaluated based on their conceptual coverage, reliability, validity, responsiveness, usefulness, and wheelchair contribution, which indicated how well the tool isolated the effect of the wheelchair on activity and participation outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: A number of conceptual, psychometric, and applicability issues were identified with the 11 wheelchair-specific measures included in the review. A majority of the measures were mobility focused. No single tool received excellent ratings in all areas of the review. Some of the most frequent issues identified included a failure to account for differences attributable to different wheelchairs and wheelchair seating, limited psychometric testing, and high administrative and respondent burden. CONCLUSIONS: Good reliability evidence was reported for most of the measures, but validity information was only available for 6 of the 11 measures, and responsiveness information for 3. This review suggests that these measures could be improved with further psychometric testing and with some modification to ensure that the contribution of the wheelchair to activity and participation outcomes is clearly identified.], accnum: %q[18503817], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Mortenson, W.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Independent mobility is a key factor in determining readiness for discharge for older patients following acute hospitalisation and has also been identified as a predictor of many important outcomes for this patient group. This review aimed to identify a physical performance instrument that is not disease specific that has the properties required to accurately measure and monitor the mobility of older medical patients in the acute hospital setting. METHODS: Databases initially searched were Medline, Cinahl, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restriction or limits on year of publication until July 2005. After analysis of this yield, a second step was the systematic search of Medline, Cinahl and Embase until August 2005 for evidence of the clinical utility of each potentially suitable instrument. Reports were included in this review if instruments described had face validity for measuring from bed bound to independent levels of ambulation, the items were suitable for application in an acute hospital setting and the instrument required observation (rather than self-report) of physical performance. Evidence of the clinical utility of each potentially suitable instrument was considered if data on measurement properties were reported. RESULTS: Three instruments, the Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS), Hierarchical Assessment of Balance and Mobility (HABAM) and the Physical Performance Mobility Examination (PPME) were identified as potentially relevant. Clinimetric evaluation indicated that the HABAM has the most desirable properties of these three instruments. However, the HABAM has the limitation of a ceiling effect in an older acute medical patient population and reliability and minimally clinically important difference (MCID) estimates have not been reported for the Rasch refined HABAM. These limitations support the proposal that a new mobility instrument is required for older acute medical patients.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: With the growing marketing of alternate tobacco products, advocacy of harm reduction, and smoke free air policies, an overall increase in Smokeless Tobacco (ST) use has been observed since the 1970s. Numerous studies have been published addressing nicotine dependence measures for smokers; however, research in the field of ST dependence measures is scarce. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to summarize the psychometric properties of ST dependence measures by evaluating the reliability and validity of these scales through peer review research. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted within the databases of PubMed and OVID Medline. Four publications reporting on the psychometric properties of ST dependence measures were identified; two regarding FTQ based scales, one regarding an FTND based scale, and one comparing two of these modified scales. A predefined set of criteria was used to assess the psychometric properties of these measures. RESULTS: ST dependence measures depend heavily on two underlying factors, heaviness of tobacco use and withdrawal. The internal consistency of the measures was low to moderate, Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.30 to 0.52 Cotinine was used as criterion variable to validate the results of the dependence measures. Concurrent validity against DIS-IV-ND based diagnosis was not established for modified FTQ scale. Predictive validity of these ST dependence scales was measured as abstinence of ST use at three and six months. FTQ-ST was predictive of abstinence at three months however failed to predict six months abstinence. CONCLUSION: FTQ and FTND based measures have inherited shortcomings and have limited psychometric properties. With ease of use and wide application in tobacco research, these measures provide preliminary foundation for studying ST dependence. However, the complexity of tobacco dependence requires a multidimensional measure with high validity and reliability for effective prevention care and for research purposes.], accnum: %q[22244704], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Mushtaq, N.", "Beebe, L.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The number of studies reporting on outcomes after total ankle arthroplasty is continuously increasing. As the use of valid outcome measures represents the cornerstone for successful clinical research, we aimed to identify the most frequently used outcome instruments in ankle arthroplasty studies and to analyze the evidence to support their use in terms of different quality criteria. A systematic review of the literature identified 15 outcome instruments reported in 79 original studies. The most commonly used measures were the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score (n = 41), the Kofoed ankle score (n = 21), a visual analog scale assessing pain (n = 15), and the generic SF-36 (n = 6). Eight additional instruments were used only once or twice. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society and Kofoed instruments include a clinical examination and score up to 100 points. Evidence to support their use in terms of validity, reliability, responsiveness, and interpretability is limited, raising the question whether their use is justified. Self-reported questionnaires related to ankle osteoarthritis or arthroplasty are rather disregarded in the current literature, and only the Foot Function Index is associated with evidence in terms of the above-mentioned quality criteria.

Record.create(abstract: %q[This paper reviews the existing literature on health-related quality of life assessments conducted in bipolar disorder patients, and provides recommendations for the use of specific scales to measure health-related quality of life in this population. A comprehensive review of the literature revealed only a handful of studies in bipolar disorder that had incorporated quality of life assessments. While instruments from the medical outcomes study (MOS) were the most frequently used to measure health-related quality of life, a number of other instruments like the psychological general well being scale (PGWB), the streamlined longitudinal interview clinical evaluation from the longitudinal interval follow-up evaluation (SLICE/LIFE), the Euroqol, (EQ-5D), the Lehman's quality of life interview (QLI), and the quality of life in depression scale (QLDS) were also used. Only three studies out of ten reported the psychometric properties of the measures used. In the absence of a disease-targeted measure, a combination of the SF-36 and the PGWB is presently recommended as the battery of choice to assess the health-related quality of life of individuals with bipolar disorder.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: A growing body of literature documents associations of maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy with fetal, infant and child behaviour and development. However, findings across studies are often inconsistent, which may in part be due to differences in stress definitions and assessments. METHODS: We systematically reviewed methods applied to assess maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy in studies looking at associations with biobehavioural outcomes in the offspring. A systematic literature search was performed on Web of Science and PubMed for the time period between January 1999 and October 2009. Psychometric instruments assessing maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy were identified and described if data on psychometric properties were available. RESULTS: We identified 115 publications that assessed psychosocial stress during pregnancy with validated methods. These publications applied overall 43 different instruments assessing constructs falling under seven categories, ordered according to their frequency of use: anxiety, depression, daily hassles, aspects of psychological symptomatology (not reduced to anxiety or depression), life events, specific socio-environmental stressors and stress related to pregnancy and parenting. If available, we provide information on validity and reliability of the instruments for samples of pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Within the 'prenatal stress' research, a broad range of instruments is applied to assess psychosocial stress during pregnancy. Prenatal stress research should take into consideration that the variety of methods in use might hamper the comparability of stress research results.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The use of quality of life (QoL) instruments in chronic pelvic pain (CPP) will allow a more objective assessment of patient-centred clinical outcomes. However, there is concern that not enough emphasis is placed on clinical face validity (i.e. issues which are of importance to patients and reflect their experiences and concerns). To explore this issue, we performed a systematic review of published research. Relevant papers were identified through electronic scanning of six electronic databases and by manual searching of bibliographies of known primary and review articles. Studies were selected if they assessed women with CPP for life quality, either developing QoL instruments or applying them as an outcome measure. Selected studies were assessed for the quality of their QoL instruments using a 17-item checklist, including 10 items for clinical face validity and seven items for measurement (psychometric) properties. A total of 19 articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. The generic Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) was used most frequently, being employed in 10/19 (53%) of the studies. Three studies developed disease-specific QoL instruments for CPP complying with 59 - 77% of the quality criteria. Overall, quality assessment showed that only 4/18 (22.2%) studies complied with more than half the criteria for face validity, whereas 12/18 (66.6%) studies complied with more than half of the criteria for measurement properties (P = 0.0001).

METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted. Data related to the content, administration, scoring, reliability, validity and responsiveness was abstracted. RESULTS: Eleven instruments met the inclusion criteria. Seven instruments include questions with content from Chapters 4 to 9 in the ICF activities and participation component. Four instruments exclude Chapter 5 (self-care). Most of the instruments assess subjective aspects of participation. Evidence on reliability was available for 10 instruments and the majority met the criteria for group level comparisons for internal consistency and reproducibility in the health conditions assessed. In terms of validity, dimensionality was assessed in eight instruments, with six using modern measurement methods. Participation instruments have been compared with various generic and/or disease-specific instruments, but they have not been compared with each other. Evidence on responsiveness was only available for four instruments. CONCLUSIONS: There has been considerable interest in developing instruments to measure participation.

Record.create(abstract: %q[STUDY DESIGN: A systematic search of the literature. OBJECTIVES: To critically review instruments that assess participation in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: Vancouver, British Columbia. METHODS: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsychInfo) were searched for studies published between 1980 and March 2008. Instruments were included if information was published in English in at least one peer-reviewed journal on its measurement properties (reliability, validity and responsiveness) in a sample that included adults with SCI. Instruments were evaluated using criteria proposed for disability outcome measures. RESULTS: Six instruments were included: Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART); Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPA); Assessment of Life Habits Scale (Life-H); Occupational Performance History Interview; Physical Activity Recall Assessment for People with Spinal Cord Injury; and Reintegration to Normal Living Index. Evidence supporting the reliability of the instruments was reported for four of the six instruments and was adequate. Validity was assessed in all the instruments. Only the Life-H and CHART have been compared with each other. No evidence on responsiveness was available. CONCLUSION: The instruments differ in how participation is operationalized. Currently, the CHART that measures objective aspects of participation has the most evidence supporting its measurement properties. More evidence is becoming available for instruments such as the IPA, which consider the person's perspective.

Studies of any design, evaluating methods for estimating wound diameter, depth, surface area, or volume in patients with pressure ulcers were included. Eligible evaluations had to report intra- or inter-rater reliability, accuracy, agreement, or feasibility of methods. Electronic databases and other sources were accessed for study identification. Included studies were critically appraised using a modified checklist for diagnostic test evaluations. Twelve studies were included. Most had methodological problems and/or used inappropriate statistical methods. Reliable methods for measuring pressure ulcer surface area may include: grid tracings from photographs combined with whole plus partial square count; a portable digital pad; and stereophotogrammetry combined with computerized image analysis. The agreement between photographic tracing and direct transparency tracing may be satisfactory (both methods being combined with computerized planimetry). No definitive conclusions could be reached about studies of diameter or depth; this means that there is little evidence to underpin recommendations in clinical guidelines.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Although quality of life (QOL) is an important treatment outcome in head and neck cancer (HNC), cross-study comparisons have been hampered by the heterogeneity of measures used and the fact that reviews of HNC QOL instruments have not been comprehensive to date. We performed a systematic review of the published literature on HNC QOL instruments from 1990 to 2010, categorized, and reviewed the properties of the instruments using international guidelines as reference. Of the 2766 articles retrieved, 710 met the inclusion criteria and used 57 different head and neck-specific instruments to assess QOL. A review of the properties of these utilized measures and identification of areas in need of further research is presented. Given the volume and heterogeneity of QOL measures, there is no gold standard questionnaire. Therefore, when selecting instruments, researchers should consider not only psychometric properties but also research objectives, study design, and the pitfalls and benefits of combining different measures. Although great strides have been made in the assessment of QOL in HNC and researchers now have a plethora of quality instruments to choose from, more work is needed to improve the clinical utility of these measures in order to link QOL research to clinical practice.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Little is known about the availability and psychometric properties of instruments to measure quality of life (QOL) in clinical research on Japanese patients with breast cancer. The purpose of this systematic review is to find reliable and valid instruments available in Japan, and to summarize their characteristics. METHODS: Instruments available in Japan were found through a systematic search of the literature. Each instrument identified was evaluated for item development, reliability, validity, interpretability and utility. RESULTS: Six questionnaires to measure health-related QOL (the QOL-ACD, the EORTC QLQ-C30, the EORTC QLQ-BR23, the FACT-B, the SF-36, the WHO/QOL-26) and five scales to quantify the psychological burden (the STAI, the POMS, the SDS, the HADS, the GHQ), for which reliability and validity have been documented, are available in Japanese. All instruments were developed in foreign countries except for the QOL-ACD. Two of the QOL questionnaires were specific to breast cancer (the EORTC QLQ-BR23, the FACT-B). Though the measurements can be interpreted in some manner, the meaning of change scores over time has been documented for only three instruments (the EORTC QLQ-C30, the FACT-B, and the GHQ).

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the instruments used to assess postural control and fear of falling in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to synthesize and evaluate their breadth of content and measurement properties. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, PEDro, and OTSeeker databases searched in September 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Two independent reviewers performed the selection of articles, the ICF linking process and quality assessment. Only quantitative studies were included, irrespective of language or publication date. DATA EXTRACTION: This systematic review comprised two phases. Phase 1 aimed to identify the commonly used instruments to assess postural control and fear of falling in the COPD literature. The breadth of content of each instrument was examined based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). In phase 2, a measurement property search filter was adopted and used in four electronic databases to retrieve properties reported in the COPD population. The COSMIN checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of each measurement property reported. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seventeen out of 401 publications were eligible in phase 1. Seventeen instruments were identified including 15 for postural control and 2 for fear of falling assessment. The Berg Balance Scale, the Short Physical Performance Battery, and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale were the most frequently used instruments to assess postural control and fear of falling respectively. The ICF categories covered varied considerably among instruments. The Balance Evaluation Systems test and ABC presented the greatest breadth of content. Measurement properties reported included criterion predictive validity (4 instruments), construct validity (11 instruments) and responsiveness (1 instrument), with inconsistent findings based on 'fair' and 'poor' quality studies.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: Treatment advances in multiple myeloma have increased expected survival from months to years for some patients. Alongside improved survival emerges a need to better understand and measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL), both in research and clinical settings. OBJECTIVES: (i) Identify HRQOL tools validated for use in myeloma; (ii) identify issues important to HRQOL from the point of view of patients with myeloma; (iii) describe the measurement properties of each HRQOL tool; (iv) evaluate the content validity of HRQOL tools in terms of their ability to capture all issues important to patients and (v) explore the suitability of each HRQOL tool for use in different settings. METHOD: Systematic literature review of six databases with no limits by date or language. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies reported validation of 13 HRQOL instruments. Seven studies identified issues important to HRQOL from the patients' perspective. No instrument was comprehensive to all issues important to patients. The EORTC-QLQ-C30 and MY24 have undergone the most comprehensive psychometric validation. Most validation occurred in trial patients and not clinically representative groups. No studies evaluated clinical utility of tools alongside routine practice. CONCLUSION: The best existing HRQOL tools are designed predominantly for use in research. Reliable, valid and responsive tools exist for this purpose, but may miss issues important to patients. The design of HRQOL measures should be guided by intended utility, whether for research or clinical practice, and further validation of HRQOL tools in clinically representative groups is needed.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to systematically review the content validity and measurement properties of all physical function (PF) scales which are currently validated for use with patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed in the Scopus and PubMed databases to identify articles on the development or psychometric evaluation of PF scales for patients with RA. The content validity of included scales was evaluated by linking their items to the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF). Furthermore, available evidence of the reliability, validity, responsiveness, and interpretability of the included scales was rated according to published quality criteria. RESULTS: The search identified 26 questionnaires with PF scales. Ten questionnaires were rated to have adequate content validity. Construct validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability and responsiveness was rated favourably for respectively 15, 11, 5, and 6 of the investigated scales. Information about the absolute measurement error and minimal important change scores were rarely reported. CONCLUSION: Based on this literature review, the disease-specificHAQ and the generic SF-36 can currently be most confidently recommended to measure PF in RA for most research purposes.

Evaluation of methodological quality of studies found was done by using the 'COSMIN-checklist'. Full text, original articles, published in English after 1990 were included. Articles had to concern the development or evaluation of the measurement properties of self-reported, parent-reported and/or teacher- or clinician-reported questionnaires assessing or screening externalizing mental health problems in immigrant ethnic minority youths. Specific results of analyses on (an) immigrant ethnic minority group had to be given. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies evaluating 18 instruments met our criteria. Most studies concerned instruments with known validity in Western populations, tested mainly in African Americans. Considering methodological quality, inequivalences between ethnicities were found, self-reports seemed to perform better, and administration of an instrument influenced reliability and validity.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Survival rates for patients with bone tumors have increased dramatically over the past few decades. Unfortunately, many patients face functional limitations resulting from disease management, but there is little evidence regarding physical functioning in adolescents with bone tumors. This lack is largely due to the absence of a standardized measure for evaluating adolescent sarcoma physical functioning. This review discusses considerations in searching for a measure of adolescent physical functioning, evaluates measures previously used in assessing functional outcome in young sarcoma patients, reviews self-report measures of pediatric physical functioning, and makes recommendations for future research. PROCEDURE: Electronic databases were searched for studies published between 1980 and 2004. Studies examining physical functioning in adolescent sarcoma patients and those describing measures of pediatric physical functioning were included. RESULTS: The study includes measures previously used in the adolescent bone tumor literature (Musculoskeletal Tumor Society, Mankin, Groningen Activity Restriction Scale, Toronto Extremity Salvage Score [TESS]), and three measures of pediatric physical function (Functional Disability Inventory, Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument [PODCI], Activities Scale for Kids [ASK]). The TESS, PODCI, and ASK each met at least four of the outlined applicability and feasibility components. CONCLUSION: The search for a measure of physical functioning for adolescent sarcoma patients requires an exploration of many developmental and measurement issues. Based on the sensibility review presented, the TESS, PODCI, and ASK are recommended for further evaluation of content and of the measurement properties of reliability, validity, and responsiveness, prior to their use in evaluating adolescent sarcoma patients.], accnum: %q[16047380], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Pakulis, P.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Health-Related Quality of Life is an important measure of illness perception on the part of the patient. In this review, the current status of the Health-Related Quality of Life assessment in studies concerning inflammatory bowel disease is examined and the various instruments proposed for this purpose are considered and compared. METHODS: A search was made of the Medline database, for relevant articles since 1980. Standard criteria were used for including studies for further evaluation. RESULTS: All studies on measuring Health-Related Quality of Life in inflammatory bowel disease patients conclude that the instruments used were valid and reliable assessment tools. Valid instruments that have been proposed for the assessment of health-related quality of life are: the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, the Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient Concerns, an Inflammatory Bowel Disease-specific questionnaire developed in Cleveland, the Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease Health Status Scales and a Disease-specific questionnaire developed in the University of Padova. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing health-related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease patients is an ever-expanding practice, especially in clinical trials. The instruments that, currently, satisfy most demands for simplicity and validity are the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, reflecting primarily disease activity, and the Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient Concerns which corresponds more to the psychological and social aspects of inflammatory bowel disease from the patient's point of view.], accnum: %q[11142577], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Pallis, A.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Measurements from pressure biofeedback units (PBUs) can be used to evaluate the activity of the transversus abdominis (TrA) muscle indirectly. These measurements can classify patients or monitor the progress of treatment programmes for people with low back pain. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review studies on the measurement properties of PBUs for the assessment of TrA activity. DATA SOURCES: Eligible studies were identified through searches of PUBMED, CINAHL and BIREME (1990 to 2009). In addition, hand searches of journals and citation tracking were performed. STUDY SELECTION: Full-text studies involving any type of clinimetric tests of PBU measurement for the assessment of TrA activity were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers selected the studies, extracted the data and assessed methodological quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to the heterogeneity of study designs and statistical analysis, it was not possible to pool the data for a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies were typically of low quality and recruited healthy subjects rather than patients with low back pain. The studies found moderate to good reproducibility (intra-class correlation coefficients from 0.47 to 0.82) and acceptable construct validity (intra-class correlation coefficients from 0.48 to 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence about the measurement properties of PBUs for the assessment of TrA activity is mainly based on studies with suboptimal designs, and the findings from these studies are likely to be overly optimistic. The most important clinical questions about the measurement properties of PBUs for the assessment of TrA activity are yet to be answered.], accnum: %q[21497243], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: [], author: ["de Paula Lima, P.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Studies examining quality of life (QoL) in cancer survivors have relied on instruments specific to the cancer patient population. METHOD: MEDLINE and PsycINFO were systematically searched to identify instruments and papers reporting the psychometric qualities of relevant instruments. Two reviewers undertook data extraction with respect to reliability, validity, predictive validity, responsiveness, acceptability, readability, cross cultural acceptability and feasibility. RESULTS: Forty-two instruments were identified. Most were either measures of general health-related QoL or developed for individuals in active treatment. Nine were developed specifically for cancer survivors. None met the rigorous psychometric standards set by the review. All established acceptable levels of validity, however, only one instrument (Quality of Life-Cancer Survivors) demonstrated adequate test-retest reliability. Acceptability, feasibility and predictive validity remain unexamined. Readability was examined in only two (Cancer Survivors' Unmet needs and Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors (QLACS)). Only two instruments (QLACS and Impact of Cancer) have been developed with a wide range of cancer survivors. Generally, shorter-term cancer survivors (1-5 years) are underrepresented.

METHOD: A review of literature included articles that evaluated an intervention, position, equipment or surface for comfort or discomfort. Electronic databases, hand searches and internet sources were used. RESULTS: In addition to several theoretical papers on comfort, 29 studies were identified that used 'comfort' or 'discomfort' as outcomes. There was a lack of consistency in measurement of comfort and researchers used a wide range of different scales and tools. Objective and subjective measures are described. The impact of symptoms, environmental variables and emotional factors was generally not considered. Two instruments evaluating subjective comfort or discomfort were identified that have been carefully developed and psychometrically tested. Both have potential for use in clinical practice and research - one developed for wheelchair seating and one for wearable computers.

Record.create(abstract: %q[There has been an intensified focus on assessment of community functioning in individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). Several reviews of functional measures for SMI have been published, yet the assessment of vocational functioning has received limited attention. The purpose of this review was to describe existing measures of vocational functioning developed for individuals with SMI. Twelve measures were identified: 9 situational assessments and 3 performance based measures. Information on the development, intended purpose, administration and psychometric properties of each measure was compiled from published reports. To further evaluate and compare these measures they were each rated on 4 criteria: practicality, reliability, validity, and comprehensiveness. Results indicated that no single measure emerged as superior across all criteria. Most measures had adequate reliability and tended to be well validated, particularly those developed in a research context, while situational assessments had greater practicality. Few measures provided information on their sensitivity to change as a result of intervention. Suggestions for use of specific measures for clinical assessment and outcome evaluation purposes are presented. Challenges to implementation of these measures in contemporary vocational rehabilitation settings are identified and the need for further research in this area is highlighted.

Record.create(abstract: %q[STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review, clinical measurement. OBJECTIVE: To review and summarize the evidence regarding the psychometric properties of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: A comprehensive review of the existing literature was undertaken using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) systematic review guidelines. Studies were included if they reported the psychometric properties of the KOOS or the KOOS-Physical Function Shortform (KOOS-PS). Papers written in both English and German were analyzed. Studies of patients undergoing primary total TKA or TKA revision, or those with severe osteoarthritis and awaiting TKA, were considered. The methodological quality of the included articles was assessed using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments checklist. RESULTS: Six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 5 evaluated psychometric properties of the KOOS and 1 evaluated the KOOS-PS. Both the KOOS and KOOS-PS have moderate-to-high construct validity with existing validated self-report measures. However, construct validity of the KOOS function in sport and recreation subscale was weak. Further, these instruments demonstrated a high level of responsiveness, with effect sizes and standard response means of greater than 0.80. Overall, both questionnaires demonstrated clinically acceptable reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.70 or greater). However, somewhat lower reliability was observed for the KOOS function in sport and recreation subscale (intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.45 and 0.65, respectively) and the other symptoms subscale (internal consistency, alpha = .56).

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Over the last 20 years, a number of instruments developed for the assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in dementia have been introduced. The aim of this review is to synthesize evidence from published reviews on HRQL measures in dementia and any new literature in order to identify dementia specific HRQL instruments, the domains they measure, and their operationalization. METHODS: An electronic search of PsycINFO and PubMed was conducted, from inception to December 2011 using a combination of key words that included quality of life and dementia. RESULTS: Fifteen dementia-specific HRQL instruments were identified. Instruments varied depending on their country of development/validation, dementia severity, data collection method, operationalization of HRQL in dementia, psychometric properties, and the scoring. The most common domains assessed include mood, self-esteem, social interaction, and enjoyment of activities. CONCLUSIONS: A number of HRQL instruments for dementia are available. The suitability of the scales for different contexts is discussed. Many studies do not specifically set out to measure dementia-specific HRQL but do include related items.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: A comprehensive review was made of the literature on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) and economic outcomes of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common of all cancers in childhood. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of the review were to locate and describe measures of HRQL used in pediatrics and in pediatric oncology that might be applicable to ALL, to summarize studies that have applied HRQL measures to ALL, to identify and summarize economic evaluations of the costs and consequences of care for pediatric ALL, and to identify areas requiring further research. DATA SOURCES: To identify the HRQL literature in pediatric ALL, searches were run on the major biomedical and social science bibliographic databases. Search terms included a variety of MeSH and other thesaurus terms, text words, names of HRQL instruments, and the names of key authors in the field. The economic literature searches included most of the same databases, with the addition of the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database and EconLit. Searches on specific authors and instruments and hand searches were also conducted. STUDY SELECTION: Only English language studies published from 1975 through 2000 were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Standardized data extraction forms were used to abstract information from HRQL and economic evaluation studies. Two reviewers independently screened the search results, and differences were resolved by consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: A number of generic HRQL measures, both adult and pediatric, have been applied in pediatric ALL. In addition, a number of pediatric oncology-specific instruments and pediatric oncology disease-specific instruments have been developed. Most of these instruments have been used to measure the health status of patients undergoing therapy. Despite the limited numbers of patients and resources available to assess HRQL measures in children with cancer, a fairly substantial body of literature has been published. Economic studies of pediatric ALL have only recently been undertaken. Most studies focus on a particular, narrow aspect of costs associated with the disease. There are relatively few cost-effectiveness studies that compare the costs and consequences of two or more treatment options. There are no published, comprehensive economic evaluations of pediatric ALL. CONCLUSIONS: HRQL measures provide not only important information on the improvements offered by new therapies but also an outcome measure for economic evaluations. Recently developed HRQL measures and applications that include the direct assessments of children are important contributions. By the age of 7 or 8 years, children can generally provide reliable responses. Furthermore, children often provide information that is not available from parental reports (e.g., in the more subjective areas of pain and emotion). However, the use of multiple viewpoints, such as the patient, parent, and health professional perspectives, can provide valid and important complementary information. Expertise in HRQL measurement should be included in the design of most future trials. Funds for HRQL research should be made available to enhance the scope of HRQL activities by organizations such as the Children's Oncology Group. In the near future, further work to generate evidence of validity for available HRQL measures for use in children with ALL will be a high priority. Continuation of inquiries into the methods for HRQL assessment of younger children (i.e., preschoolers) is also a priority.], accnum: %q[15504922], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Pickard, A.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Executive function pertains to higher cognitive processes historically linked to frontal lobes. Several measures are available to screen for executive function; however, no gold standard exists. The difficulty in assessing executive function is the existence of its many subsets. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the psychometric properties of executive function measures and determine the most effective measure(s) through a systematic review of the literature. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy utilised a comprehensive literature review of articles written in the English language published from January 2003 to September 2009. The following electronic databases were searched: SCOPUS, PUBMED, Medline Ovid, PsychArticles and CINAHL Plus. Initial key words used were 'executive function', 'measures', 'reliability' and 'validity' followed by the addition of 'traumatic brain injury'. The initial search elicited 226 articles, of which 28 were retrieved. After further exclusion 19 were included in the review. RESULTS: Eight measures underwent factor analysis and 18 underwent various forms of reliability and/or validity testing. Factor analysis showed different aspects of executive functions. According to preset evaluation criteria, only the Test of Practical Judgment performed all of the recommended reliability and validity testing. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSION: Of the recently developed measures, several show promise for future use yet further validity and reliability testing is warranted.

Record.create(abstract: %q[STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted. OBJECTIVE: To identify, evaluate, and compare standard scales for assessing neck pain or dysfunction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The degree of a patient's neck pain or dysfunction can be evaluated using standardized scales at the time of a clinical encounter or during the performance of clinical research protocols. The choice of a scale with the most appropriate characteristics, however, is always a challenge to clinicians and researchers. METHODS: Articles concerning scales for functional evaluation of neck pain or dysfunction were identified by computer searching of MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 1999) and CINAHL (1985 to 2000), citation tracking using the Citation Index, hand searching of relevant journals, and correspondence with experts. RESULTS: Five standard scales were found. Three scales were remarkably similar in terms of structure and psychometric properties: the Neck Disability Index, the Copenhagen Neck Functional Disability Scale, and the Northwick Park Scale. However, only the first instrument has been revalidated in different study populations. The Neck Pain and Disability Scale provides a visual template for collection of information, but its usefulness is limited if the questionnaire must be read to the patient. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale is very sensitive to functional changes in individual patients, but comparisons between patients are virtually impossible. CONCLUSIONS: The five scales identified in this study have similar characteristics. The Neck Disability Index, however, has been revalidated more times for evaluation of patient groups. For individual patient follow-up evaluation, the Patient-Specific Functional Scale has high sensitivity to change, and thus represents a good choice for clinical use. The final choice should be tailored according to the target population and the purpose of the evaluation.], accnum: %q[11880837], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Pietrobon, R.", "Coeytaux, R.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: To characterise clinical assessment methods for spasticity and/or its functional consequences in clinical patient populations at risk to suffer from spasticity. METHOD: Systematic literature search and manual-based two-step review process of psychometric properties of clinical assessment scales for spasticity and associated phenomena, as well as of functional scales with an association with spasticity. Reviewed psychometric properties included internal consistency, interrater, intrarater as well as retest reliability, construct validity, ecological validity, and responsiveness. RESULTS: Until May 2003 electronic database searches established a reference pool of 4151 references of which 90 references contributed to the review objectives. An additional 20 references were identified by an informal reference search. Twenty-four clinical scales that assess spasticity and/or related phenomena as well as 10 scales for 'active function' and three scales for 'passive function' with an association with spasticity could be identified. Some evidence signals that a high interrater reliability of the Ashworth and modified Ashworth scales can be achieved, however not in all circumstances. For many scales, reliability data is, however, missing. This is especially true for test retest reliability. Information about construct validity can promote our understanding of what individual scales are likely to assess. Many scales have been able to document changes after therapeutic intervention.

Record.create(abstract: %q[QUESTION: What is the inter-rater reliability for measurements of passive physiological or accessory movements in upper extremity joints? DESIGN: Systematic review of studies of inter-rater reliability. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with and without upper extremity disorders. OUTCOME MEASURES: Range of motion and end-feel using methods feasible in clinical practice. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included of which 11 demonstrated acceptable inter-rater reliability. Two studies satisfied all criteria for internal validity while reporting almost perfect reliability. Overall, the methodological quality of studies was poor. ICC ranged from 0.26 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.69) for measuring the physiological range of shoulder internal rotation using vision to 0.99 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.0) for the physiological range of finger and thumb flexion/extension using a goniometer. Measurements of physiological range of motion using instruments were more reliable than using vision. Measurements of physiological range of motion were also more reliable than measurements of end-feel or of accessory range of motion. CONCLUSIONS: Inter-rater reliability for the measurement of passive movements of upper extremity joints varies with the method of measurement. In order to make reliable decisions about joint restrictions in clinical practice, we recommend that clinicians measure passive physiological range of motion using goniometers or inclinometers], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["van de Pol, R.

The acetabular index, measured using X-rays had good reliability but moderate concurrent validity with 3D CT measurements; 3D CT scan indexes had greater reliability. The measurement of the neck shaft angle using X-rays showed excellent concurrent validity with measurements from 3D CT scans and excellent reliability.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: In clinical trials of acute mania, a number of measures have been used to assess the severity of illness and its response to treatment. Rating instruments need to be validated in order for a clinical study to provide reliable and meaningful estimates of treatment effects. OBJECTIVE: To critically assess rating scales used in measuring mania. METHOD: A systematic search of the literature, retrieval of reports of clinical trials of drugs used in mania and the rating scales and a critical and systematic appraisal of their quality. RESULTS: Eight symptom-rating scales were identified. The Mania Rating Scale (MRS) was the most commonly used for assessing treatment response. Two more recently developed scales are the Manchester Nurse Rating Scale for Mania (MNRS-M) and the Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M). The latter appears well validated but its in-use reliability needs to be explored further. The translation of observed changes in instrumental ratings into clinically meaningful change has to be established further. In particular, the relative weighting to be attached to the individual items needs further study. The advantage of the MRS is that there is a relatively extensive database of studies based on it and this will no doubt ensure that it remains a gold standard for the foreseeable future.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Health impairment often leads to work impairment in the form of both absenteeism and presenteeism (i.e. reduced productivity while at work). Several self-report productivity instruments have been designed over the past few years to measure the impact of illness on productivity at work and/or in non-work activities. In a review of the literature we identified six generic subjective instruments - the Endicott Work Productivity Scale, Health and Labor Questionnaire, Health and Work Questionnaire, Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) - that could theoretically be used in any working population. These instruments were usually validated against other subjective measures (such as health-related QOL). Each productivity instrument has benefits in certain research settings, but the psychometric properties of the WPAI have been assessed most extensively. It was the most frequently used instrument and has also been modified to measure productivity reductions associated with specific diseases (e.g. allergic rhinitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, chronic hand dermatitis). The WLQ has also been tested extensively to measure the general health impact and impact of specific conditions. Two migraine-specific subjective instruments were also identified: the Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire and the Migraine Work and Productivity Loss Questionnaire, of which the latter was found to have better psychometric properties. Productivity outcomes are useful in that they characterise the impact of an illness in the workplace and show the effect of treatment on productivity. Evidence of psychometric properties and generalisability of different instruments was found to a varying degree. Thus, further research is needed to assess the accuracy and usefulness of individual instruments in certain research settings. Health-related productivity has been increasingly recognised as an important component of the burden of illness associated with a given disease; without it, one cannot reliably assess this burden.], accnum: %q[14974873], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Prasad, M.", "Wahlqvist, P.", "Shikiar, R.", "Shih, Y.

The included papers were evaluated using a quality assessment instrument previously developed to evaluate pain assessment tools. RESULTS: Five different pain assessment tools were identified that had been used with unconscious or sedated intensive care patients. All five instruments included behavioural indicators and three included physiological indicators. Their psychometric properties varied and it was not possible to deduce their clinical utility.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To identify, summarize, and evaluate patient-reported outcome questionnaires for use in head and neck cancer surgery with the view to making recommendations for future research. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of the English-language literature, with the use of head-and-neck-surgery-specific keywords, was performed in the following databases: Medline, Embase, HAPI, CINAHL, Science/Social Sciences Citation Index, and PsycINFO from 1966 to March 2006. DATA EXTRACTION AND STUDY SELECTION: All English-language instruments identified as patient-reported outcome questionnaires that measure quality of life and/or satisfaction that had undergone development and validation in a head and neck cancer surgery population were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Twelve patient-reported outcome questionnaires fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Of these, four were developed from expert opinion alone or did not have a published development process and seven questionnaires lacked formal item reduction. Only three questionnaires (EORTC Head and Neck Module, University of Michigan Head and Neck Quality-of-life Questionnaire, and Head and Neck Cancer Inventory) fulfilled guidelines for instrument development and evaluation as outlined by the Medical Outcomes Trust. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous instrument development is important for creating valid, reliable, and responsive disease-specific questionnaires. As a direction for future instrument development, an increased focus on qualitative research to ensure patient input may help to better conceptualize and operationalize the variables most relevant to head and neck cancer surgery patients.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes in cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery are increasingly important for clinical research endeavors. Traditional surgical outcomes, centered on morbidity and mortality, remain important but are no longer sufficient on their own. Quality of life has become a crucial research topic augmenting traditional concerns focused on complications and survival. Given this, reliable and valid patient questionnaires are essential for aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgeons. METHODS: The authors performed a systematic literature review to identify patient-reported outcome measures developed and validated for use in cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery patients. Qualifying instruments were assessed for adherence to international guidelines for health outcomes instrument development and validation. RESULTS: The authors identified 227 health outcomes questionnaires used in breast surgery studies. After 135 generic instruments, 65 ad hoc instruments, seven oncologic instruments, 11 education questionnaires, and two non-English-language questionnaires were excluded, seven measures remained. Detailed analysis revealed that six of the seven measures had undergone limited development and validation. Only one measure, the Breast-Related Symptoms Questionnaire, demonstrated adequate development and validation in its target population. It had, nevertheless, significant content limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Valid, reliable, and responsive instruments to measure patient-reported outcomes in cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery are lacking.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: A wide variety of scoring systems have been proposed to assess severity of psoriasis. Given its importance as a health issue both for patients and health care systems, it is critically important to evaluate the validity and reliability of existing outcome measures. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the extent of validation including the validity, reliability, sensitivity to change and ease of use of available outcome measures for psoriasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of all clinical studies (prospective and retrospective) investigating the severity of psoriasis patients and published between January 1980 and June 2009. The following methodological validation and quality criteria were recorded systematically: construct validity, content validity and internal consistency, intra-observer variation and inter-observer variation, sensitivity to change and acceptability/ease of use assessed as time required to perform measurement. RESULTS: Based on methodological validation and quality criteria, six clinical severity scores were selected and analysed (PASI, BSA, PGA, LS-PGA, SPI and SAPASI scores). We did not find substantial evidence of construct validity for any of the psoriasis clinical severity scores. Content validity was studied by considering the PASI score as gold standard. The relative content validity was good for the LS-PGA, PGA, and SPI scores, which correlated strongly with the PASI score. The SAPASI and PASI scores showed moderate correlation. Internal consistency was good for the PASI and LS-PGA scores. The PASI, BSA, PGA and LS-PGA scores displayed limited intra-observer variation. The inter-observer variation was low for LS-PGA (ICC < 0.5) and SAPASI, moderate for PASI, SPI and PGA and high for BSA (ICC > 0.8). The PASI score and the SAPASI displayed moderate sensitivity to change. DISCUSSION: Based on this systematic review, it appears that none of the severity scores used for psoriasis meets all of the validation criteria required for an ideal score. However, we can conclude that the PASI score is the most extensively studied psoriasis clinical severity score and the most thoroughly validated according to methodological validation criteria. Despite certain limitations, use of the PASI score can be recommended for scientific evaluation of the clinical severity of psoriasis], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Puzenat, E.", "Bronsard, V.", "Prey, S.", "Gourraud, P.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: To analyze the characteristics of instruments designed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children, developed or adapted from 2000 to 2010 in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Spain, and Uruguay. METHODS: The protocol-led literature review included database searching (e.g., Medline, ISI Science Citation Index) and manual searching to retrieve studies focused on measures of HRQOL, health status, or well-being addressed to children and adolescents. Country-specific filters were applied to identify studies carried out in the participating countries. The characteristics of the instruments and type of studies were analyzed. Descriptive characteristics and psychometric properties were analyzed following the guidelines of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medical Outcomes Trust. RESULTS: Ninety-nine documents were included. Thirty-one questionnaires were identified, 24 instruments were adapted, and the psychometric properties of 20 HRQOL instruments were reported in the study period. There was substantial variability in the number and characteristics of the dimensions included. Reliability was generally acceptable, and the majority of instruments provided data on internal consistency (n = 18) and, to a lesser extent, on test-retest reliability (n = 12). Nearly all studies reported construct validity, but only four analyzed sensitivity to change. CONCLUSIONS: There is a scarcity of instruments to measure HRQOL of children and adolescents in the countries analyzed. Certain psychometric characteristics have been reasonably well tested, but others, most notably sensitivity to change, have not been tested in most instruments.

Record.create(abstract: %q[We assessed the clinometric characteristics of rating scales used for the evaluation of motor impairment and disability of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), conducting a systematic review of PD rating scales published from 1960 to the present. Thirty studies describing clinometrics of 11 rating scales used for PD were identified. Outcome measures included validity (including factor structure), reliability (internal consistency, inter-rater, and intrarater) and responsiveness. We traced three impairment scales (Webster, Columbia University Rating Scale [CURS] and Parkinson's Disease Impairment Scale), four disability scales (Schwab and England, Northwestern University Disability Scale [NUDS], Intermediate Scale for Assessment of PD, and Extensive Disability Scale), and four scales evaluating both impairment and disability (New York University, University of California Los Angeles, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], and Short Parkinson Evaluation Scale). The scales showed large differences in the extent of representation of items related to signs considered responsive to dopaminergic treatment or to those signs that appear late in the disease course and lack responsiveness to treatment. Regardless of the scale, there was a conspicuous lack of consistency concerning inter-rater reliability of bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. Overall disability items displayed moderate to good inter-rater reliability. The available evidence shows that CURS, NUDS, and UPDRS have moderate to good reliability and validity. In contrast to their widespread clinical use for assessment of impairment and disability in PD, the majority of the rating scales have either not been subjected to an extensive clinometric evaluation or have demonstrated clinometric shortcomings.

Record.create(abstract: %q[This article addresses the issues in measuring pain in critically ill children, provides a comprehensive review of the pain measures for children aged between 0 and 3 years, and discusses their applicability to this group of children. When children are critically ill, pain can only exacerbate the stress response that already exists, to the extent that homeostasis cannot be maintained. Severity of illness is thus likely to affect physiologic and behavioural pain responses that would normally be demonstrated in healthy children. The problem of differentiating pain from other constructs adds to the complexity of assessing pain in non-verbal children. A pain measure to be useful clinically must be adapted to the developmental age of the target population. Search of electronic databases and other electronic sources was supplemented by hand review of relevant journals to identify published and unpublished pain measures for use in children aged between 0 and 3 years. Twenty eight pain measures were identified in the literature; 11 for neonates only, 11 for children aged between 0 and 3 years, and six for children more than 12 months. These measures vary in relation to their psychometric properties, clinical utility and the context in which the study was performed. These measures may not be suitable for the critically ill young child, because the items included were derived from observations of healthy or moderately sick children, and may not reflect pain behaviour in those who are critically ill.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is not routinely reported in the literature on chronic liver disease (CLD). Few studies have examined quality of life (QOL) in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) despite its significant functional impact. One of the reasons for the lack of HRQOL measurement in patients with PBC may be the absence of a well-recognized and widely used measure that clinicians can use in ordinary clinical practice. The aim of this study is to evaluate HRQOL measures used in patients with PBC and examine the suitability of the measures for these patients. METHODS: A literature search identified reports that focused on any aspect of QOL in patients with PBC. Key texts were identified containing generic, domain-specific, and condition-specific measures. The identified measures were systematically evaluated for appropriateness, acceptability, reliability, validity, precision, and responsiveness. RESULTS: Twenty measures were identified from 9 key texts. Six of the measures were previously validated generic measures; 10 were domain-specific measures previously used to measure fatigue, depression, and psychological distress in general and psychiatric populations; and 4 measures had been developed in patients with CLD. Reporting of reliability and validity generally was consistent for all measures used. However, reporting of the remaining criteria was variable, particularly in relation to responsiveness over time and acceptability of the measures to patients with PBC.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of children and adolescents is increasingly considered a relevant topic for research. Instruments to assess quality of life in children and adolescents of a generic as well as disease- or condition-specific nature are being developed and applied in epidemiological surveys, clinical studies, quality assurance and health economics. This paper attempts to give an overview on the state of the art of HR-QOL assessment in children as it relates to methodological and conceptual challenges. Instruments available in international or cross-cultural research to assess HR-QOL in generic terms were identified and described according to psychometric data provided and the width of application. In an initial literature search, several challenges in the assessment of child and adolescent HR-QOL were identified, ranging from conceptual and methodological to practical aspects. Seven specific major issues were considered: (i) What are the dimensions of HR-QOL relevant for children and adolescents, and do suitable instruments for their measurement exist? (ii) Can these dimensions be collected in a cross-culturally comparable way? (iii) What advantages and disadvantages do self-rated versus externally evaluated HR-QOL measurements of children and adolescents have? (iv) How can HR-QOL be assessed in an age-appropriate way? (v) What are the advantages and disadvantages of disease-specific and generic data collection? (vi) What advantages and disadvantages do profile and index instruments have? (vii) How can HR-QOL be connected with utility- preference values? In a second literature search we identified nine generic HR-QOL instruments and four utility health state classification systems that complied with the prespecified inclusion criteria.

Record.create(abstract: %q[UNLABELLED: EVIDENCE-BASED BACKGROUND: In both cosmetic and postbariatric body contouring populations, the primary determinants of success are patient satisfaction and quality of life (QOL). These patient-reported outcomes (PRO) are ideally measured with specially-designed, procedure- or condition-specific questionnaires. OBJECTIVE: The authors identify and appraise all patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures (questionnaires) developed for patients undergoing body contouring surgery. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Ebase, CINAHL, HAPI, Science Citation Index/Social Sciences Citation Index, Ovid Evidence Based Medicine databases were searched from the inception of each database through August 2010. Articles included in the study described the development and/or psychometric evaluation of a PRO measure developed for body contouring patients. Each measure was then appraised for adherence to internationally-recommended guidelines for item generation, item reduction, and psychometric evaluation. RESULTS: The following five PRO questionnaires were identified by our search: one liposuction (the Freiburg Questionnaire on Aesthetic Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery, FQAD), one general plastic surgery (Derriford Appearance Scale, DAS-59/24), and three breast reduction measures (the Breast Reduction Assessed Severity Scale Questionnaire, BRASSQ; Breast Related Symptoms questionnaire, BRS; and the BREAST-Q reduction module. Detailed examination of these measures revealed that the FQAD, DAS-59, and BRS are limited by both their content range and psychometric properties. The BRASSQ and BREAST-Q both have strong psychometric properties, and the BREAST-Q is unique in its inclusion of items covering specific postoperative issues such as scarring. CONCLUSIONS: While instruments are available for measuring outcomes in breast reduction patients, reliable, valid, and responsive PRO measures are lacking for the majority of body contouring procedures.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To survey the existing literature to identify, summarize, and evaluate procedure- and condition-specific outcome measures for use in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery. METHODS: A review of the English-language literature was performed to identify outcomes instruments specific for targeted facial plastic surgery interventions and conditions. A search was performed using MEDLINE (1950 to September 2007), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health) (1982 to September 2007), and PsychINFO (1806 to September 2007). Outcomes instruments were categorized as patient-reported or clinical efficacy measures (observer-reported or objective measures). Instruments were then categorized to include relevant details on the intervention, degree of validation, and subsequent use. RESULTS: Sixty-eight distinct instruments were identified (23 patient-reported, 35 observer-reported, and 10 objective measures), with some overlap among categories. Most patient-reported measures (76%) and half observer-reported instruments (51%) were developed in the past 10 years. The rigor of validation varied widely among measures, with formal validation being most common among the patient-reported outcome measures.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Currently there is a wide range of health status measures that aim to assess general health status in people with cognitive impairment. However, the validity and/or applicability to this patient group are largely unknown. This has implications for the assessment of treatment outcomes and rehabilitation, for prognostic purposes, for planning services, and for determining the benefits and adverse effects of health technologies targeted at these patient groups. OBJECTIVES: (1) To identify the general health status measures that have been validated in patients with cognitive impairment. (2) To assess the extent to which these measures have been validated. (3) To draw out the implications of the findings for the use of existing measures and for future primary research in this area. METHODS. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies that assessed general health status in people with cognitive impairment due to acquired brain injury (traumatic brain injury, cerebro-vascular accident or multiple sclerosis (MS)) or learning disability (LD) were included in the review. Studies that used general health status instruments measuring only one general health dimension, and studies that only featured participants with cognitive impairment due to dementia were excluded. METHODS. SEARCH STRATEGY: A wide range of relevant databases were searched for studies on cognitive impairment, general health status measures, and validation of health status measures. A handsearch of general health status bibliographies was also conducted. Data were collected on the general health status measure used, the population characteristics, aims of the study, validity details, and conclusions. RESULTS: The review includes data from 71 studies, reported in 83 separate publications. In total 34 different general health status measures were described in the 83 publications, with the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) the most frequently used measures (20 and 19 studies, respectively). These studies included a total of 98 instrument validations, 52 of which definitely or probably included people with cognitive impairment. Six measures were extensively validated (quality scores ranged from 0.25 to 0.5, on a scale from 0 to 1) in studies in which more than 50% of the respondents were people with cognitive impairment. A further three measures were also validated in studies in which more than 50% of the respondents were people with cognitive impairment, but their level of validation was more limited (quality scores ranged from 0.1 to 0.2). Five measures were validated in studies in which 20-50% of the respondents were cognitively impaired, which may limit their relevance to participants with cognitive impairment (quality scores ranged from 0.1 to 0.6). The SF-36 was also validated in two studies in which 20-50% of the respondents were cognitively impaired and the quality score was 0.3. Finally, nine of the measures were only validated in studies in which less than 20% of the respondents were cognitively impaired. For these measures it was unclear whether the findings applied to people with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Very few measures have been validated specifically for cognitively impaired respondents. Studies where at least 50% of the respondents were cognitively impaired generally showed poorer validity results compared with studies with fewer cognitively impaired persons, indicating that general health status measures designed for the general population are not automatically suitable for people with cognitive impairment. The few measures that were specifically developed for people with cognitive impairment also reported poor validity results. Therefore, there are no validated instruments available for use in cognitively impaired respondents; existing measures, specifically designed for use in these populations, should be used with caution. The most promising measure is the MS-Quality of Life Interview (MS-QLI) for MS patients. The MS-QLI was thoroughly validated in 300 MS patients and the results were good, except for the 'social function' subscale. However, only 20-50% of the respondents in this study had cognitive impairment. Most information on the validity of general health status measures was found in studies among people with LD. For these patients, six measures were found that have been validated in a populations where more than 50% of the respondents were cognitively impaired LD patients. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Existing general health status measures should be used with caution in individuals with cognitive impairments. (2) There is no evidence to indicate the most suitable general health status measure for use in economic evaluations of cognitive impairment. (3) There is little evidence to support the validity of proxy assessments in cognitively impaired populations.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Shoulder instability is common. Multiple questionnaires are used in clinical studies. The purpose of this study is to find and synthesize evidence on the usefulness of self-administered questionnaires specific to shoulder instability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a systematic review using a standard search strategy (publications from 1966-2008) on databases (Medline, Embase); a structured search was conducted and supplemented by expert consultation. Raters conducted data extraction and critical appraisal using structured tools. A descriptive synthesis was performed. RESULTS: In total, 25 published questionnaires used for patients with shoulder instability were identified. The Rowe questionnaire is the oldest and the most frequently used scale. After excluding questionnaires that were not validated, that necessitated physical examination, or that did not address instability symptoms, we identified 3 validated self-report measures specific to shoulder instability: Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI), Oxford Shoulder Instability Questionnaire, and Melbourne Instability Shoulder Scale. Quality ratings on validation studies varied from 50% to 79%. A failure to establish clear guidelines for interpretation was a common flaw. Although there are insufficient studies (n = 3) to determine the best measure, the WOSI appears to have the best supporting evidence with excellent reliability/responsiveness (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.95; effect size, 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for the psychometric properties of shoulder instability is limited but suggests that reliable and responsive measures are available. More studies of the WOSI and competing scales in head-to-head comparison are needed to determine their optimal usage. Cultural adaptation is also needed to permit widespread usage.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The number of available walking tests has increased dramatically over the past decades. Therefore, it is highly important to help clinicians choose the most appropriate walking test for a specific setting. This systematic review aimed to critically evaluate the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of clinical walking speed in a broad population of elderly persons living in the community, sheltered housing, or institutions. Literature searches were performed in several different databases. Key words were based on the topic of the measurement properties of performance-based clinical tools for quantifying walking. The instrument selected for review was walking speed. The methods and results of all the evaluated measurement properties were rated by using a standard checklist for appraising the qualitative attributes and measurement properties of the instrument. A total number of 3,781 abstracts were reviewed, and 86 articles were chosen for inclusion. Habitual walking speed seems to be highly reliable in community-dwelling people and residents in mixed settings. There have not been any studies that accord with our inclusion and exclusion criteria that have evaluated the reliability of maximum walking speed in an aged population. Walking speed is a highly valid test, both at habitual and maximum speed. Few studies gave information about responsiveness for walking speed, which means that these results cannot be evaluated properly.

Record.create(abstract: %q[UNLABELLED: The use of accurate and reliable clinical and imaging modalities for quantifying leg-length discrepancy (LLD) is vital for planning appropriate treatment. While there are several methods for assessing LLD, we questioned how these compared. We therefore evaluated the reliability and accuracy of the different methods and explored the advantages and limitations of each method. Based on a systematic literature search, we identified 42 articles dealing with various assessment tools for measuring LLD. Clinical methods such as use of a tape measure and standing blocks were noted as useful screening tools, but not as accurate as imaging modalities. While several studies noted that the scanogram provided reliable measurements with minimal magnification, a full-length standing AP computed radiograph (teleoroentgenogram) is a more comprehensive assessment technique, with similar costs at less radiation exposure.

Record.create(abstract: %q[There are numerous methods available for assessing patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other forms of dementia. Quality-of-life (QOL) assessment is unique among these methods. The subjective nature of quality of life provides healthcare professionals with the opportunity of incorporating the value systems of patients and their carers into their assessments. A systematic review was carried out to assess the published data (and some unpublished data) on QOL assessment tools and instruments that claim to measure quality of life in dementia. A number of measures or methods used in the literature for assessing the quality of life of patients with dementing illnesses were identified. It was decided to present the resultant review in 2 parts that correspond to the 2 main groups into which the instruments were categorised. The first (part 1), looked at measures used to assess the impact of disease as well as instruments at a developmental or testing stage. The second (part 2), includes instruments that claim to measure quality of life in studies documenting the impact of a drug in this therapeutic area. This second group consists mainly of instruments identified as being used to assess quality of life during clinical trials in dementia/AD. As in part 1, this part of the review was unable to identify any validated methods of assessing the quality of life of both patients with dementia and their carers at the same time. The ideal instrument must show that it can reliably, reproducibly and comprehensively assess quality of life for both patients with dementia and their carers. It should also demonstrate that it can measure quality of life effectively using a practical administration technique that does not place any unnecessary burden on either informal carers, other healthcare workers involved or the patient themselves. In addition, any measure intended for use in assessing the impact of drug treatment on quality of life must demonstrate sensitivity to change, also known as responsiveness. All these criteria are even more important when measuring quality of life as an outcome during clinical trials of a new antidementia drug, because the data generated are likely to influence decisions made by regulatory bodies about whether to grant licences that are required by pharmaceutical companies to market their products. Further cross-sectional and longitudinal research is required to ensure that the available instruments possess the essential psychometric criteria that must be demonstrated prior to their utilisation in clinical trials of any compound developed for use in dementia/AD. Ongoing conceptual research may still be useful in exploring new ways of assessing quality of life in this important therapeutic area.], accnum: %q[10346414], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Salek, S.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of advanced imaging techniques in the detection of hand osteoarthritis (OA) and hand OA progression. METHODS: PubMed/Medline and Embase were searched until April 2012 for studies on imaging of hand OA that presented quantitative data on validity, reliability or responsiveness. Articles presenting only data on conventional radiography (CR) were excluded. Methodological quality was assessed by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) checklist for validity, the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies (QAREL) for reliability and the COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) for responsiveness. RESULTS: Of 627 citations, 25 studies on ultrasonography (US), MRI or scintigraphy were included. No studies on CT, positron emission tomography or single photon emission CT met our eligibility criteria. Validity was generally assessed against healthy controls, CR or clinical examination. Overall, US and MRI detected more disease than CR and found significant differences between patients and healthy controls. Scintigraphy detected fewer pathological joints than CR. Intra- and inter-reader reliability varied for US (kappa=0.01-1.0) and MRI (kappa=0.15-0.84 and intraclass correlation coefficient=0.21-0.99) and was good for scintigraphy (kappa=0.61-0.84). There were no responsiveness studies for MRI. US responsiveness studies showed a reduction of soft-tissue changes after treatment which correlated with decrease in pain (r=0.7-0.8). For scintigraphy, scores decreased over time while CR showed progression of hand OA. CONCLUSIONS: MRI and US seem to be the most promising candidates for early detection of hand OA and for future use in clinical trials.

We analysed the construction framework, development process, validation process, reliability, internal consistency (IC), responsiveness and limitations of each of these outcome measures. Our analysis reveals that BCTQ, MHQ and PEM have comprehensive frameworks, good validity, reliability and responsiveness both in the hands of the developers, as well as independent researchers. The UEFS and Hi-Ob scale need validation and reliability testing by independent researchers.

Record.create(abstract: %q[We aimed to perform a comprehensive systematic review of the existing ataxia scales. We described the disorders for which the instruments have been validated and used, the time spent in its application, its validated psychometric properties, and their use in studies of natural history and clinical trials. A search from 1997 onwards was performed in the MEDLINE, LILACS, and Cochrane databases. The web sites ClinicalTrials.gov and Orpha.net were also used to identify the endpoints used in ongoing randomized clinical trials. We identified and described the semiquantitative ataxia scales (ICARS, SARA, MICARS, BARS); semiquantitative ataxia and non-ataxia scales (UMSARS, FARS, NESSCA); a semiquantitative non-ataxia scale (INAS); quantitative ataxia scales (CATSYS 2000, AFCS, CCFS and CCFSw, and SCAFI); and the self-performed ataxia scale (FAIS). SARA and ICARS were the best studied and validated so far, and their reliability sustain their use. Ataxia and non-ataxia scores will probably provide a better view of the overall disability in long-term trials and studies of natural history. Up to now, no clear advantage has been disclosed for any of them; however, we recommend the use of specific measurements of gait since gait ataxia is the first significant manifestation in the majority of ataxia disorders and comment on the best scales to be used in specific ataxia forms. Quantitative ataxia scales will be needed to speed up evidence from phase II clinical trials, from trials focused on the early phase of diseases, and for secondary endpoints in phase III trials.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to summarize studies reporting on the psychometric properties of measures commonly utilized in spinal cord injury (SCI) pain research to better inform clinicians and researchers on the selection of appropriate pain-related instruments.

METHODS: A detailed literature search was completed to extrapolate articles that described the psychometric properties of pain measures specifically used in SCI populations. Psychometric properties data of the identified measures such as reliability coefficients, type and magnitude of validity correlations, responsiveness as well as logistical factors (that is, interpretability, acceptability and feasibility) were extracted from manuscripts in accordance with similar projects designed to review outcome measures. RESULTS: Five different pain classification schemas, six self-report measures of pain, and two measures of pain impact on functioning were selected based on our inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies identified in these areas reported inter- and intra-rater reliability information. Of the little validity data found for pain screening measures, it was difficult to compare due to the variability of the descriptors used. No data on sensitivity was identified.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Several disease-specific questionnaires to measure pain and disability in patients with neck pain have been translated. However, a simple translation of the original version doesn't guarantee similar measurement properties. The objective of this study is to critically appraise the quality of the translation process, cross-cultural validation and the measurement properties of translated versions of neck-specific questionnaires. METHODS: Bibliographic databases were searched for articles concerning the translation or evaluation of the measurement properties of a translated version of a neck-specific questionnaire. The methodological quality of the selected studies and the results of the measurement properties were critically appraised and rated using the COSMIN checklist and criteria for measurement properties. RESULTS: The search strategy resulted in a total of 3641 unique hits, of which 27 articles, evaluating 6 different questionnaires in 15 different languages, were included in this study. Generally the methodological quality of the translation process is poor and none of the included studies performed a cross-cultural adaptation. A substantial amount of information regarding the measurement properties of translated versions of the different neck-specific questionnaires is lacking. Moreover, the evidence for the quality of measurement properties of the translated versions is mostly limited or assessed in studies of poor methodological quality.

METHODS: Bibliographic databases were searched for articles concerning the development or evaluation of the measurement properties of an original version of a self-reported questionnaire, evaluating pain and/or disability, which was specifically developed or adapted for patients with neck pain. The methodological quality of the selected studies and the results of the measurement properties were critically appraised and rated using a checklist, specifically designed for evaluating studies on measurement properties. RESULTS: The search strategy resulted in a total of 3,641 unique hits, of which 25 articles, evaluating 8 different questionnaires, were included in our study.

The other questionnaires show positive results, but the evidence for each measurement property is mostly limited, and at least 50% of the information on measurement properties per questionnaire is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply that studies of high methodological quality are needed to properly assess the measurement properties of the currently available questionnaires.

Record.create(abstract: %q[AIMS: To identify generic measures of health-related quality of life (HRQL) for children and adolescents developed for use within general populations. Instruments are evaluated on the basis of evidence relating to their reliability and validity. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were used to identify instruments, which were then assessed against predefined criteria. Information relating to instrument content, population, reliability and validity was extracted from published papers. RESULTS: Sixteen instruments were identified that had been evaluated among a general population of children or adolescents. Four instruments had reported data on both internal consistency and test-retest reliability. All except two instruments had undergone some degree of construct validation. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) has been the most extensively evaluated for younger populations but is available as a parent-completed measure only. The new version of the Child Health and Illness Profile (CHIP-CE) is particularly promising and has parallel child- and parent-completed versions for young ages. The weight of evidence suggests that versions of these two instruments are suitable for older children.

The comparative validity and reliability of outcome measurements for assessing atopic eczema (AE) severity is unclear. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the validity, reliability, sensitivity to change, and ease of use of outcome measurements for AE. We also sought to give recommendations on which outcomes to use in clinical research and for clinical monitoring. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and survey of clinical experts and patients. RESULTS: Twenty published outcome measurements were identified. There is evidence of adequate construct validity for 3 measurements (Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index [SCORAD], Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI], and Three Item Severity Score), adequate internal consistency of 1 scale (Patient-oriented Eczema Measure [POEM]), adequate interobserver reliability of 5 measurements (Basic Clinical Scoring System; Nottingham Eczema Severity Score; Objective Severity Assessment of Atopic Dermatitis; Six Area, Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis severity score; and SCORAD), adequate test-retest reliability of 1 scale (POEM), and adequate sensitivity to change of 3 measurements (EASI, SCORAD, and Investigators' Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment). Most outcome measurements have adequate content validity, as assessed by patients and experts. Data on the time to perform the assessment was identified for 8 outcome measurements. Only SCORAD, EASI, and POEM have been tested sufficiently and performed adequately. CONCLUSION: There are too many published outcome measures for AE. Most have not been tested properly or perform adequately when tested, and their continued use hampers scientific communication. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Only SCORAD, EASI, and POEM currently perform adequately.

Record.create(abstract: %q[During breast cancer radiotherapy, nearly all patients will experience radiodermatitis. Study objectives were as follows: (1) systematically review the literature on radiodermatitis and breast cancer; (2) summarize and describe patient-rated radiodermatitis measures; (3) determine whether consensus exists regarding subjective radiodermatitis measurement; and (4) provide recommendations for future research. PubMed and CINAHL were searched from their inception through August 2009. Study inclusion and exclusion criteria were: full abstract available, manuscript in English, focused on radiodermatitis resulting from breast cancer radiotherapy, and described a patient-rated empirical assessment of radiodermatitis. Three reviewers examined abstracts, and decisions about inclusion were reached by consensus. Twenty-two of 237 mutually identified studies met selection criteria. Using a standardized abstraction form, 3 authors independently extracted relevant information. Results indicated that (1) only 9% of the studies reviewed included a patient-rated measure; (2) generally, extant scales are very brief and focus almost exclusively on physical reactions, and (3) there is no "gold standard" measure of patient-rated radiodermatitis at this time.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Depression is a common comorbid condition in Parkinson's disease (PD) and a major contributor to poor quality of life and disability. However, depression can be difficult to assess in patients with PD due to overlapping symptoms and difficulties in the assessment of depression in cognitively impaired patients. As several rating scales have been used to assess depression in PD (dPD), the Movement Disorder Society commissioned a task force to assess their clinimetric properties and make clinical recommendations regarding their use. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the use of depression scales in PD and determine which scales should be selected for this review. The scales reviewed were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part I, Cornell Scale for the Assessment of Depression in Dementia (CSDD), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Seven clinical researchers with clinical and research experience in the assessment of dPD were assigned to review the scales using a structured format. The most appropriate scale is dependent on the clinical or research goal. However, observer-rated scales are preferred if the study or clinical situation permits. For screening purposes, the HAM-D, BDI, HADS, MADRS, and GDS are valid in dPD. The CES-D and CSDD are alternative instruments that need validation in dPD. For measurement of severity of depressive symptoms, the Ham-D, MADRS, BDI, and SDS scales are recommended. Further studies are needed to validate the CSDD, which could be particularly useful for the assessment of severity of dPD in patients with comorbid dementia. To account for overlapping motor and nonmotor symptoms of depression, adjusted instrument cutoff scores may be needed for dPD, and scales to assess severity of motor symptoms (e.g., UPDRS) should also be included to help adjust for confounding factors. The HADS and the GDS include limited motor symptom assessment and may, therefore, be most useful in rating depression severity across a range of PD severity; however, these scales appear insensitive in severe depression. The complex and time-consuming task of developing a new scale to measure depression specifically for patients with PD is currently not warranted.], accnum: %q[17394234], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Schrag, A.", "Barone, P.", "Brown, R.

Record.create(abstract: %q[This review describes the characteristics and evaluates the psychometric qualities (process of testing and the results) of thirteen delirium instruments. Delirium instruments differ in goal (diagnosis, screening symptoms severity), type of data on which the rating is based (observation, interview or test of patients), the rater qualities required, the number of items and the rating time needed. Most instruments are based on the Diagnostic Statistical Manual criteria and measure signs and symptoms as described by these criteria. Reliability of delirium instruments shows good to excellent results. Validity of the delirium instruments is overall fair to good. Differences exist, however, in the degree to which reliability and validity were tested and the quality of the testing procedures. Most instruments are not further developed and tested after the initial study. Conclusion of this review is that most delirium instruments show promising results but need further testing. Testing is needed in different samples and on a broader range of aspects with regard to reliability and validity. Much emphasis should be given to the procedures used in future studies. Ease of use is an aspect of testing that is so far not taken into account, however, is important for use of instruments in clinical practice. A minority of instruments can be seen as "ready to use" instruments meaning well tested in more than one sample with good results. For screening high-risk, elderly hospitalized patients, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale and the Delirium Observation Screening Scale are recommended. The Confusion Assessment Method is the best diagnostic tool and the Delirium Rating Scale shows best results in screening symptom severity. For ICU patients the CAM-ICU is recommended. The MDAS is well tested in cancer patients.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of behavioral assessment scales for disorders of consciousness (DOC); provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical use based on their content validity, reliability, diagnostic validity, and ability to predict functional outcomes; and provide research recommendations on DOC scale development and validation. DATA SOURCES: Articles published through March 31, 2009, using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Biomedical Reference Collection, and PsycINFO. Thirteen primary terms that defined DOC were paired with 30 secondary terms that defined aspects of measurement. Scale names, abbreviations, and authors were also used as search terms. Task force members identified additional articles by using personal knowledge and examination of references in reviewed articles. STUDY SELECTION: Primary criteria included the following: (1) provided reliability, diagnostic validity, and/or prognostic validity data; (2) examined a cohort, case control, or case series sample of persons with DOC who were age older than or equal to 18 years; and (3) assessed in an acute care or rehabilitation setting. Articles were excluded if peer review was not conducted, original data were not reported, or an English language article was not available. The initial search yielded 580 articles. After paired rater review of study abstracts, guideline development was based on 37 articles representing 13 DOC scales. DATA EXTRACTION: Rater pairs classified studies addressing diagnostic and prognostic validity by using the American Academy of Neurology 4-tier level of evidence scheme, and reliability by using a task force-developed 3-tier evidence scheme. An independent quality review of ratings was conducted, and corrections were made. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R), Sensory Stimulation Assessment Measure (SSAM), Wessex Head Injury Matrix (WHIM), Western Neuro Sensory Stimulation Profile (WNSSP), Sensory Modality Assessment Technique (SMART), Disorders of Consciousness Scale (DOCS), and Coma/Near-Coma Scale (CNC) have acceptable standardized administration and scoring procedures. The CRS-R has excellent content validity and is the only scale to address all Aspen Workgroup criteria. The SMART, SSAM, WHIM, and WNSSP demonstrate good content validity, containing items that could distinguish persons who are in a vegetative state, are in a minimally conscious state (MCS), or have emerged from MCS. The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness Score (FOUR), WNSSP, CRS-R, Comprehensive Levels of Consciousness Scale (CLOCS), and Innsbruck Coma Scale (INNS) showed substantial evidence of internal consistency. The FOUR and the CRS-R showed substantial evidence of good interrater reliability. Evidence of diagnostic validity and prognostic validity in brain injury survivor samples had very high levels of potential bias because of methodologic issues such as lack of rater masking. CONCLUSIONS: The CRS-R may be used to assess DOC with minor reservations, and the SMART, WNSSP, SSAM, WHIM, and DOCS may be used to assess DOC with moderate reservations. The CNC may be used to assess DOC with major reservations. The FOUR, INNS, Glasgow-Liege Coma Scale, Swedish Reaction Level Scale-1985, Loewenstein Communication Scale, and CLOCS are not recommended at this time for bedside behavioral assessment of DOC because of a lack of content validity, lack of standardization, and/or unproven reliability.], accnum: %q[21112421], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine, Brain Injury-Interdisciplinary Special Interest Group Disorders of Consciousness Task Force", "Seel, R.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Until recently, little attention has been paid to anxiety symptoms in dementia. However, anxiety is common in this population, and associated with poor outcome and quality of life. The current review examines the existing literature around three major themes: the definition of anxiety in dementia, the properties of available instruments for assessment, and the clinical characteristics of anxiety in this population. Defining anxiety in individuals with dementia is complicated by the overlap between symptoms of anxiety, depression and dementia, and by the influence of the source of information. Several instruments are available to assess anxiety in this population, including general neuropsychiatric instruments and two scales designed specifically for this purpose. The reliability of these instruments is acceptable, but their validity has not been sufficiently examined, and they may discriminate poorly between anxiety and depression. Anxiety may be higher in vascular dementia than in Alzheimer's Disease, and it decreases in the severe stages of dementia. It is associated with poor quality of life and behavioral disturbances, even after controlling for depression. Little is known, however, about its social and environmental correlates.

The main objectives of this review were to identify validated CRF instruments, and populations in whom these tools have been validated. METHODS: We used a systematic review methodology. Three separate searches were performed using different MeSH terms in Pub Med and Ovid databases. Articles were analyzed for validation and reliability. RESULTS: A total of 1453 papers from 3 different searches identified 40 instruments (3 unidimensional and 37 multidimensional). Instruments varied by psychometric properties, items, scale, dimension, cancer site, and population. Five were optimally tested for validity and reliability. Completion rates, sensitivity to change, and test-retest reliability were reported for a few. DISCUSSION: Most tools had been validated in mixed populations and are relatively insensitive to differences in fatigue to cancer stage. Most instruments are burdensome for those with advanced cancer. The Brief Fatigue Inventory and 3 fatigue items of the European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire Fatigue Scale (EORTC QLQ-C30) are optimal instruments in advanced cancer.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) questionnaires can be helpful in diagnosing dementia and are often used for clinical follow-up and treatment evaluation in dementia patients. Despite the large number of questionnaires, their quality has received little attention. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the measurement properties of all available structured informant-based (I)ADL questionnaires, developed or validated for use in demented patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and EMBASE for psychometric articles on (I)ADL questionnaires. In addition, reference lists of all retrieved articles were screened. Standardised criteria were used to assess the quality of the measurement properties. When possible, investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. Two authors independently extracted studies and performed the quality assessment of the questionnaires. FINDINGS: Thirty-two articles were selected, covering 12 (I)ADL questionnaires. Information on 52.3% of the quality aspects was not available, 32.4% of the ratings were indeterminate, 8.1% were positive, and 7.2% were negative.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Purpose: Performance-based measures of gross motor skills are required for children with developmental coordination disorder to quantify motor ability and objectify change. Information related to psychometrics, clinical utility, feasibility, and client appropriateness and acceptability is needed so that clinicians and researchers are assured that they have chosen the most appropriate and robust tool. Methods: This review identified performance-based measures of gross motor skills for this population, and the research evidence for their clinimetric properties through a systematic literature search. Results: Seven measures met the inclusion criteria and were appraised for their clinimetric properties. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children and the Test for Gross Motor Development (second version) scored highest on appraisal. Conclusions: The 2 highest scoring measures are recommended in the first instance for clinicians wishing to evaluate gross motor performance in children with developmental coordination disorder. However, both measures require further testing to increase confidence in their validity for this population.

Several methods have been developed to measure a patient's awareness of deficits after ABI; however, no criterion standard currently exists to measure this phenomenon. Objective: To review all instruments for measuring awareness of deficits and evaluate their psychometric and conceptual properties as well as their feasibility. Methods: Systematic literature search for available awareness measurement instruments used in experimental ABI studies. Instruments were divided into the following 4 assessment methods: clinician ratings, structured interviews, performance-based discrepancy, and self-other rating discrepancy methods. The quality of the instruments was evaluated. Results: The literature search identified 39 instruments and 8 of these were selected. The following 3 instruments stood out in terms of quality: Self-Awareness of Deficits Interview, Patient Competency Rating Scale, and Awareness Questionnaire. Conclusion: Although these quantitative instruments are useful tools in research, they have limited utility in the clinic because they only measure intellectual awareness. Therefore, in addition to these instruments, qualitative tools should also be used to gain a complete view of a patient's awareness problem.], accnum: %q[WOS:000311221200014], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Smeets, S.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To determine the discriminative validity and reliability of the evidence base using meta-analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of published sources using the databases AMED, CINHAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library, and for unpublished material was conducted. All studies assessing the reliability, validity, sensitivity or specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound (US) of the patellofemoral joint of patients following patellar dislocation, subluxation or instability, were included. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the difference in radiological measurements between healthy controls and subjects with patellar instability in order to assess discrimination validity. A narrative assessment was used to evaluate the inter- and intra-observer reliability as well as the sensitivity and specificity of specific radiological measurements. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were reviewed. The findings indicated that there was acceptable inter-observer and intra-observer reliability and validity for different methods of assessing patellar height and the sulcus angle with X-ray, MRI and CT methods, and the tibial tubercle-trochlear groove (TT-TG) assessed using CT. There was poor reliability or validity for the assessment of severity of trochlear dysplasia and the sulcus angle using US. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to determine the reliability, validity, sensitivity or specificity of tests such as the congruence angle, lateral patellar displacement, lateral patellar tilt, trochlear depth, boss height, the crossing sign or Wiberg patellar classification.

DPN is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. A need to consider the broad impact of DPN, rather than just pain and the increasingly recognised need to assess patient-reported outcomes such as HRQL in evaluating healthcare has led to a demand for rigorous outcome measures. To identify appropriate disease-specific measures, we searched four databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL Plus. Data were extracted from each article using a standard data extraction form and the psychometric properties of each HRQL measure were reviewed. We identified three DPN-specific measures of HRQL: PN-QOL-97, Norfolk QOL-DN, NeuroQoL. All three measures satisfy at least one criterion for both reliability and validity, though all also have some disadvantages. Where there is no requirement for multi-language versions, the PN-QOL-97 is a useful instrument.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To identify currently available generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments for children and adolescents up to 19 years old, to describe their content, and to review their psychometric properties. STUDY DESIGN: Previous reviews on the subject and a new literature review from 2001 to December 2006 (MEDLINE, the ISI Science Citation Index, HealthSTAR and PsycLit) were used to identify measures of HRQOL for children and adolescents. The characteristics (country of origin, age range, type of respondent, number of dimensions and items, name of the dimensions and condition) and psychometric properties (reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change) of the instruments were assessed following international guidelines published by the Scientific Committee of the Medical Outcomes Trust. RESULTS: In total, 30 generic and 64 disease-specific instruments were identified, 51 of which were published between 2001 and 2005. Many generic measures cover a core set of basic concepts related to physical, mental and social health, although the number and name of dimensions varies substantially. The lower age limit for self-reported instruments was 5-6 years old. Generic measures developed recently focused on both child self-report and parent-proxy report, although 26% of the disease-specific questionnaires were exclusively addressed to proxy-respondents. Most questionnaires had tested internal consistency (67%) and to a lesser extent test-retest stability (44.7%). Most questionnaires reported construct validity, but few instruments analyzed criterion validity (n = 5), structural validity (n = 15) or sensitivity to change (n = 14). CONCLUSIONS: The development of HRQOL instruments for children and adolescents has continued apace in recent years, particularly with regard to disease-specific questionnaires.

However, valid outcome and severity measures for psoriasis are a prerequisite for fully informative clinical research and evidence-based medicine.

No measure could be scored on all items used in the clinimetric analysis. The Lattice System Physician's Global Assessment and Physician's Global Assessment were most highly noted. We conclude that none of the psoriasis measures is adequately validated. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index is the most commonly used clinical measure in research, but it has substantial limitations such as low response distribution, no consensus on interpretability, and low responsiveness in mild disease.

Record.create(abstract: %q[This review was designed to explore and review the range of patient-reported outcomes used to assess people with epilepsy. Literature searches were conducted through EMBASE.com and supplemented with hand searching of relevant articles. References obtained through hand searches were compared with EMBASE.com citations until we were confident that the review had reached a point of saturation. The search included English language papers published between January 1997 and March 2007. Searching through EMBASE.com yielded a total of 110 hits and the hand searches identified 35 potentially relevant studies. A total of 61 studies were considered relevant to the current review and were included in the study. Several instruments that have been designed and validated to measure patient-reported outcomes in an epilepsy population are currently being used, including the Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE)-89 and -31, the Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale and the Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory. In addition, the QOLIE-adolescent (QOLIE-AD)-48 and the Adolescent Psychosocial Seizure Inventory have been designed for use with adolescent epileptic patients.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is highly prevalent in Western countries. Because the majority of patients do not present with endoscopic abnormalities, the assessment of the symptom severity and quality of life, and their response to treatment, has become increasingly important. Self-assessed symptom questionnaires are now key instruments in clinical trials. AIM: To evaluate the validity of available GERD measurement tools. METHODS: An ideal GERD symptom assessment instrument, suitable as a primary end-point for clinical trials, should possess the following characteristics: (i) be sensitive in patients with GERD; (ii) cover the frequency and intensity of typical and atypical GERD symptoms; (iii) be multidimensional (cover all symptom dimensions); (iv) have proven psychometric properties (validity, reliability and responsiveness); (v) be practical and economical; (vi) be self-assessed; (vii) use 'word pictures' which are easy to understand for patients; (viii) respond rapidly to changes (responsiveness over short time intervals); (ix) be used daily to assess changes during and after therapy; and (x) be valid in different languages for international use. RESULTS: A literature review revealed five scales that met some of the above characteristics, but did not fulfil all criteria.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: Concepts such as health-related quality of life, disability and participation may differ across cultures. Consequently, when assessing such a concept using a measure developed elsewhere, it is important to test its cultural equivalence. Previous research suggested a lack of cultural equivalence testing in several areas of measurement. This paper reviews the process of cross-cultural equivalence testing of instruments to measure participation in society. METHODS: An existing cultural equivalence framework was adapted and used to assess participation instruments on five categories of equivalence: conceptual, item, semantic, measurement and operational equivalence. For each category, several aspects were rated, resulting in an overall category rating of 'minimal/none', 'partial' or 'extensive'. The best possible overall study rating was five 'extensive' ratings. Articles were included if the instruments focussed explicitly on measuring 'participation' and were theoretically grounded in the ICIDH(-2) or ICF. Cross-validation articles were only included if it concerned an adaptation of an instrument developed in a high or middle-income country to a low-income country or vice versa. RESULTS: Eight cross-cultural validation studies were included in which five participation instruments were tested (Impact on Participation and Autonomy, London Handicap Scale, Perceived Impact and Problem Profile, Craig Handicap Assessment Reporting Technique, Participation Scale). Of these eight studies, only three received at least two 'extensive' ratings for the different categories of equivalence. The majority of the cultural equivalence ratings given were 'partial' and 'minimal/none'. The majority of the 'none/minimal' ratings were given for item and measurement equivalence. CONCLUSION: The cross-cultural equivalence testing of the participation instruments included leaves much to be desired. A detailed checklist is proposed for designing a cross-validation study. Once a study has been conducted, the checklist can be used to ensure comprehensive reporting of the validation (equivalence) testing process and its results. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: * Participation instruments are often used in a different cultural setting than initial developed for. * The conceptualization of participation may vary across cultures. Therefore, cultural equivalence - the extent to which an instrument is equally suitable for use in two or more cultures - is an important concept to address. * This review showed that the process of cultural equivalence testing of the included participation instruments was often addressed insufficiently. * Clinicians should be aware that application of participations instruments in a different culture than initially developed for needs prior testing of cultural validity in the next context.], accnum: %q[23789790], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Stevelink, S.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The aim of this study was to systematically review the psychometric properties, interpretability and feasibility of self-report pain intensity measures for children and adolescents for use in clinical trials evaluating pain treatments. Databases were searched for self-report measures of single-item ratings of pain intensity for children aged 3-18 years. A total of 34 single-item self-report measures were found. The measures' psychometric properties, interpretability and feasibility, were evaluated independently by two investigators according to a set of psychometric criteria. Six single-item measures met the a priori criteria and were included in the final analysis. While these six scales were determined as psychometrically sound and show evidence of responsivity, they had varying degrees of interpretability and feasibility. No single scale was found to be optimal for use with all types of pain or across the developmental age span. Specific recommendations regarding the most psychometrically sound and feasible measures based on age/developmental level and type of pain are discussed.

A major problem associated with this undertreatment is the challenging nature of pain assessment and in particular the selection of accurate and useful assessment instruments. The purpose of this study was to review pain measurement instruments for acute and chronic pain suggested for use with cognitively impaired older persons and to summarize available evidence on their reliability and validity. A systematic search for pain instruments was conducted using several bibliographic databases, supplemented by a manual search of the bibliographies of retrieved articles and review chapters and by articles received from experts and clinicians in the field. Instruments were retained for review when the pain instrument was used or recommended for use with older persons with cognitive impairment. Thirty-nine instruments were reviewed; nine were excluded for various reasons. Of the remaining 30, 18 were self-report and 12 were staff administered. There were no instruments for which all major tests of reliability or validity were reported. Reliability and validity data were basic or unavailable for many instruments. One instrument had excellent validity but no reliability data. The remaining instruments had weak or adequate reliability and validity.

In this paper, we review the empirical evidence on the reliability and validity of commonly used clinical scores. Clinical scores and related reliability and validity studies were identified by systematic literature search. Scores were classified according to the type and joint. Reliability and validity studies were characterized according to design, population, number and qualification of observers, number of measurements, time interval between repeat measurements and results. Reliability and validity studies were reported for only 6 and 15 of the 45 identified clinical scores, respectively. Although comparisons are difficult due to differences in study design, relatively high reliability was reported for most measurements of pain, stiffness, and physical function, while results are less conclusive for clinical signs. Most validity studies focused on the correlation between various scores. Correlation was generally found to be high for overall numerical ratings, but scores often differed with respect to the interpretation of these ratings. Validity has been more comprehensively studied for Lequesne's scores, WOMAC, and ILAS, and these scores have shown satisfactory responsiveness to different treatment effects.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Despite being one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, fewer than 10% of depressed individuals in low-resource settings have access to treatment. Mounting evidence suggests that nonspecialist workers are capable of providing counseling and case management at the community level. They often use brief psychiatric screening instruments as clinical tools to identify cases and monitor symptoms over time. In order for such tools to be used in diverse settings, they must demonstrate adequate reliability and validity in addition to cross-cultural relevance. To be used to guide routine care they also need to be flexibly adapted and sensitive to change. The goal of this paper is to assess the cross-cultural validity of brief psychiatric screening instruments in sub-Saharan Africa, identify best practices, and discuss implications for clinical management and scale-up of mental health treatment in resource-poor settings. METHOD: Systematic review of studies assessing the validity of screening instruments for depression, anxiety, and mental distress in sub-Saharan Africa using Medline and PsycINFO. RESULTS: Sixty-five studies from 16 countries assessing the validity of brief screening instruments for depression, anxiety, and/or mental distress.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: This paper focuses on the construct validity of instruments measuring impairments in body structures and function in rheumatic disorders. The objective is: 1) to make an inventory of constructs, based on the domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Health problems (ICF), against which instruments measuring impairments in body structures and function were validated; 2) to analyse whether validation against a similar construct resulted in higher correlation coefficients than validation against a dissimilar construct. METHODS: In a systematic review papers were identified in which instruments measuring impairments in body structures and function for patients with rheumatic disorders were validated. The instruments identified were assessed on their methodological properties and the constructs against which they were validated. Subsequently, pooled (interclass) correlations of similar constructs and dissimilar constructs against which was validated were compared. An instrument was decided to have good construct validity, if the correlation coefficient was 0.50 or higher, and the measurement instrument in question is validated against similar constructs. RESULTS: In total 216 papers were identified analysing the validity of 42 different instruments. Only 16% of these instruments were validated against instruments that represent the most similar construct. In general, estimates of construct validity were lower when validated against dissimilar constructs, except for instruments measuring impairments in mental functions. CONCLUSION: There is a trend that validation against a similar construct yields higher correlation coefficients than validation against a dissimilar construct.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The objective of this study was to review and evaluate the performance of health-related quality of life (HRQL) and other health status measures used in studies of adult haemophilia and provide recommendations for future research. A systematic literature review was performed to identify HRQL and health status measures used in haemophilia. Literature was identified using medical databases, Internet and manual searches. The search was restricted to articles published in English since 1986. Ninety-six abstracts were located; 19 relevant articles were selected for detailed review. Three main types of HRQL measures were identified: generic psychometric-based HRQL (SF-36 and SF-12), utility-based HRQL [EQ-5D and Health Utilities Index (HUI)], and musculoskeletal-specific HRQL (Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2, AIMS 2) instruments. No patient-rated haemophilia-specific HRQL instrument was found. The SF-36, the EQ-5D, and the HUI were able to discriminate haemophilia patient subgroups with respect to disease severity and HIV comorbidity status. Sixteen additional scales were identified that were used to measure the different aspects of physical, psychological, and social functioning of patients. There were no clinical studies of haemophilia carried out that employed HRQL instruments, thus responsiveness of these instruments could not be evaluated. The variety of instruments used in haemophilia studies highlights the need for a tool that can capture the full impact of haemophilia and its treatment on patients' HRQL.

Record.create(abstract: %q[AIM: To identify patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) specifically developed and used to assess the impact of ophthalmic disorders in children and to systematically assess their quality as a basis for recommendations about their use in clinical and research settings. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL and AMED, supplemented by a grey literature search. Papers reporting development and validation of questionnaire instruments for assessing patient-reported outcomes of an ophthalmic disorder in patients aged 2-18 years were included. Quality was assessed by examining the purpose and psychometric properties of the instruments. Strengths and limitations were summarised with recommendations regarding use. RESULTS: Search identified 17 instruments. Of these, 11 were condition-specific and six were intended for a broader population of children and young people with visual impairment regardless of the ophthalmic condition. Three were developed for use in a specific trial and two are still in development. CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric ophthalmology PROM development and application is a developing field and new instruments are needed. There is scope for improvement in this area through (a) clarity of definitions of the underlying constructs intended to be measured at the onset of development of new instruments, (b) application of child-centred approaches and (c) adherence to extant guidance and best practice in questionnaire instrument development.], accnum: %q[23743433], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Tadic, V.", "Hogan, A.", "Sobti, N.", "Knowles, R.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is prevalent in the adult population. The associated co-morbidities and impairments can be relieved with treatment. Therefore, several rating scales have been developed to identify adults with ADHD who may benefit from treatment. No systematic review has yet sought to evaluate these scales in more detail. The present systematic review was undertaken to describe the properties, including psychometric statistics, of the currently available adult ADHD rating scales and their scoring methods, along with the procedure for development. Descriptive synthesis of the data is presented and study quality has been assessed by an objective quality assessment tool. The properties of each scale are discussed to make judgements about their validity and usefulness. The literature search retrieved 35 validation studies of adult ADHD rating scales and 14 separate scales were identified. The majority of studies were of poor quality and reported insufficient detail. Of the 14 scales, the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating scale and the Wender Utah Rating Scale (short version) had more robust psychometric statistics and content validity. More research into these scales, with good quality studies, is needed to confirm the findings of this review.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the measurement properties (i.e. internal consistency, reproducibility, validity, responsiveness and interpretability) of all performance-based methods which have been used to measure the physical function of patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Embase. Standardized criteria were applied to assess the quality of the clinimetric studies and the measurement properties. RESULTS: Twenty-six performance-based methods were included: 13 walking tests, two stair-climb tests, one chair test and ten multi-item tests. Three out of seven multi-activity tests were tested for internal consistency and two were rated positively. Fourteen tests were tested for reliability and five were rated positively. The absolute measurement error (agreement) was assessed for 10 tests. Only one test received a positive rating. Fourteen tests were tested for construct validity. Only two tests received positive ratings. Responsiveness was assessed for 12 tests, but none of them received a positive rating. A lot of indeterminate ratings were given, mostly for small studies or non-optimal analyses. CONCLUSION: Many more well-designed studies are needed to assess the measurement properties of performance-based methods.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: There is no consensus on the best approach for measuring physical activity in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. The aims of this study were (1) to identify all physical activity measures that have been validated in patients with OA of the hip or knee and to systematically review their measurement properties, and (2) to give recommendations on which instrument is most suitable for what purpose. DESIGN: A search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Sportdiscus (complete databases until November 10, 2010). Three reviewers independently evaluated the quality of the included studies, using the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Subsequently, the reviewers independently evaluated the quality of the included physical activity instruments, using the recently developed QAPAQ checklist for appraising the qualitative attributes and measurement properties of physical activity questionnaires. RESULTS: Nine studies were included, in which 12 measurement instruments were evaluated: five single-item rating scales, six multi-item questionnaires, and one pedometer. In general, the methodological quality of the studies was poor to moderate. Only the Lower-Extremity Activity Scale (LEAS) and the pedometer received positive ratings for content validity. The LEAS and Baecke questionnaire received positive ratings for reliability. The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), the Tegner score, and the LEAS received positive ratings for construct validity. The Daily Activity Questionnaire (DAQ) received a positive rating for criterion validity. Responsiveness was not evaluated for any of the included instruments. CONCLUSION: For monitoring physical activity levels of populations the UCLA or LEAS seem most useful. For studies measuring physical activity as a risk factor for developing OA or as a protective factor against functional decline there is not enough evidence for any instrument to conclude that it has adequate measurement properties. For follow-up studies on wear in joint replacement patients we recommend to use accelerometers.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: The modern standard of evaluating treatment results includes the use of rating systems. Elbow-specific rating systems are frequently used in studies aiming at elbow-specific pathology. However, proper validation studies seem to be relatively sparse. In addition, these scoring systems might not always be used for appropriate populations of interest. Both of these issues might give rise to invalid conclusions being reported in the literature. Our aim was to investigate the extent to which the available elbow-specific outcome measurement tools have been validated and the quality of the validation itself. We also aimed to provide characteristics of the populations used for validation of these scales to enable clinicians to use them appropriately. METHODS: A literature search identified 17 studies of 12 different elbow-specific scoring systems. These were assessed for validity, reliability, and responsiveness characteristics. The quality of these assessments was rated according to the Consensus Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist criteria, a standardized and validated tool developed specifically for this purpose. RESULTS: Currently, the only elbow-specific rating system that is validated using high-quality methodology is the Oxford Elbow Score, a patient-administered outcome measure tool that has been validated on heterogeneous study populations.

The field of research on FCR is an emerging area of investigation in the cancer survivorship literature, and several standardised instruments for its assessment have been developed. AIMS: This review aims to identify all available FCR-specific questionnaires and subscales and critically appraise their properties. METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken to identify instruments measuring FCR. Relevant studies were identified via Medline (1950-2010), CINAHL (1982-2010), PsycINFO (1967-2010) and AMED (1985-2010) databases, reference lists of articles and reviews, grey literature databases and consultation with experts in the field. The Medical Outcomes Trust criteria were used to examine the psychometric properties of the questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 20 relevant multi-item measures were identified. The majority of instruments have demonstrated reliability and preliminary evidence of validity. Relatively few brief measures (2-10 items) were found to have comprehensive validation and reliability data available. Several valid and reliable longer measures (>10 items) are available.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The present literature review on functional assessment in physiotherapy was carried out for the following reasons: 1) to identify the functional instruments used in the field of physiotherapy that were supported by published evidence of their psychometric qualities; 2) to investigate how these instruments relate to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF); and 3) to investigate the use of functional instruments in the financing of physiotherapy. A search of Medline from 1990 to December 2005, in the domains of functional evaluation, psychometric qualities, functional classification, and health policy in relation to physiotherapy resulted in a list of 1,567 studies. Two reviewers examined the resulting references on the basis of their title and abstract, in order to select the studies that presented data on the psychometric qualities of functional evaluation tests, leading to a final selection of 44 such studies. A selection of functional tests was identified in four major diagnostic groups treated in community physiotherapy: musculoskeletal disorders (including lower back pain), stroke, the elderly, and traumatic brain injuries. The functional tests authors identified essentially cover the body and activities dimension of the ICF. The selected tests could be used as a basis for the standardisation of functional evaluation of the major diagnostic groups treated in community physiotherapy.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a process to obtain an instrument to measure dermatology specific health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), and to adapt it into another culture, namely the Spanish-speaking community. DESIGN AND SETTING: By consensus, a multi-disciplinary team determined the qualities of an 'ideal' questionnaire as follows: need (absence of any such instrument), utility, multi-dimensionality, psychometric development, simplicity, high degree of standardisation, and accessibility. A bibliographic search was conducted on Medline, EMBASE and IME (Spanish Medical Index), using 'dermatology' and 'quality of life' as the key words, from January 1990 through to September 1997, supplemented by a second level reference search, to identify the instruments already in existence. Rather than develop a questionnaire ex novo, it was decided to make a cultural adaptation of an existing one. The questionnaires identified in the literature search were classified according to their generic or specific scope and it was decided to adapt a dermatology specific instrument. To select and compare the instruments, a model was developed which would provide an Adaptation Index (ADAPT), which includes the degree of development of psychometric properties, the formal design and the degree of standardisation at a given moment in time. RESULTS: Six dermatology specific scales were identified: Impact of Skin Disease Scale (IMPACT), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Skindex, Dermatology Quality-of-Life Scales (DQOLS), Dermatology Specific Quality of Life (DSQL) and Qualita di Vita Italiana in Dermatologia (QUAVIDERM). The ADAPT Index for each of the above was determined at the time of the study and the DLQI was chosen for adaptation (ADAPT = 77, October 1997). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed the utility of ADAPT Index to assist in the selection process of the questionnaire to adapt. The results of the analysis indicate that in order to introduce and systematically use dermatology specific HR-QOL instruments, the indices require consolidation and improvement.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: The assessment of impact and evaluation of treatment effects in chronic otitis media (OM) calls for a much broader approach than just examining the presence of middle ear effusion or hearing loss. It is increasingly recognised that this condition may result in a comprised quality of life. Several studies have used proxy completed questionnaires to objectify the illness experience associated with chronic OM. OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: To review questionnaires which have been developed to describe the effects of chronic OM on the daily functioning of children. Psychometric properties have been evaluated, in addition to discriminative and evaluative qualities. TYPE OF REVIEW: A systematic review of publications pertaining to developed questionnaires related with chronic OM. SEARCH STRATEGY: Systematic literature searches of PubMed (1966-January 2007) and EMBASE (1989-January 2007) were conducted, supplemented by using free text words to identify publications after January 2005. RESULTS: The included 15 questionnaires were developed for children with recurrent or persistent OM, describing functional health status (FHS), while two questionnaires also evaluate the effect of tympanostomy tubes insertion. The questionnaires generally cover six impact areas (physical symptoms, child development, educational performance, emotional/practical burden and general health status) with physical symptoms being the most prominant. CONCLUSIONS: The OM8-30, OMO-22 and OM-6 adequately reflect the multidimensional aspects of FHS in chronic OM. The OMO-22 and OM8-30 show the best psychometric properties for the discrimination of impact severity between children, while the OM-6 was found to have the best qualities for the evaluation of clinical change.

Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) are an important parameter in evaluating treatment. It is unclear which PRO questionnaires are specifically available for hip arthroscopy patients. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate which PRO questionnaires are valid and reliable in the evaluation of patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. METHODS: A search was conducted in Pubmed, Medline, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Pedro, EMBASE and Web of Science from 1931 to October 2010. Studies assessing the quality of PRO questionnaires in the evaluation of patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included. The quality of the questionnaires was evaluated by the psychometric properties of the outcome measures. The quality of the articles investigating the questionnaires was assessed by the COSMIN list. RESULTS: Five articles identified three questionnaires; the Modified Harris Hip Score (MHHS), the Nonarthritic Hip Score (NAHS) and the Hip Outcome Score (HOS). The NAHS scored best on the content validity, whereas the HOS scored best on agreement, internal consistency, reliability and responsiveness. The quality of the articles describing the HOS scored highest. The NAHS is the best quality questionnaire. The articles describing the HOS are the best quality articles.

Record.create(abstract: %q[GOALS OF WORK: The assessment of oral mucositis is important. There is a paucity of validated oral mucositis assessment instruments for use in children. This paper reviews the available mucositis measurement tools and their applicability to a paediatric population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search of PUBMED and bibliography searches identified articles relevant to mucositis measurement tools and the measurement of mucositis in paediatrics. RESULTS: The relevant issues in the literature could be grouped into three categories: (1) development and evaluation of oral assessment tools, (2) oral assessment in the paediatric population, and (3) challenges to the assessment of oral mucositis in children. There were numerous validated mucositis assessment scales for use in adults. Only three of these scales have received limited evaluation for use in the paediatric population. The unique challenges presented by the paediatric population are excluded from much of the discussion in the literature. CONCLUSION: The paper demonstrates the need to consider the issues specific to children.

Record.create(abstract: %q[CONTEXT: Numerous faces scales have been developed for the measurement of pain intensity in children. It remains unclear whether any one of the faces scales is better for a particular purpose with regard to validity, reliability, feasibility, and preference. OBJECTIVES: To summarize and systematically review faces pain scales most commonly used to obtain self-report of pain intensity in children for evaluation of reliability and validity and to compare the scales for preference and utility. METHODS: Five major electronic databases were systematically searched for studies that used a faces scale for the self-report measurement of pain intensity in children. Fourteen faces pain scales were identified, of which 4 have undergone extensive psychometric testing: Faces Pain Scale (FPS) (scored 0-6); Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) (0-10); Oucher pain scale (0-10); and Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS) (0-10). These 4 scales were included in the review. Studies were classified by using psychometric criteria, including construct validity, reliability, and responsiveness, that were established a priori. RESULTS: From a total of 276 articles retrieved, 182 were screened for psychometric evaluation, and 127 were included. All 4 faces pain scales were found to be adequately supported by psychometric data. When given a choice between faces scales, children preferred the WBFPRS. Confounding of pain intensity with affect caused by use of smiling and crying anchor faces is a disadvantage of the WBFPRS. CONCLUSIONS: For clinical use, we found no grounds to switch from 1 faces scale to another when 1 of the scales is in use. For research use, the FPS-R has been recommended on the basis of utility and psychometric features. Data are sparse for children below the age of 5 years, and future research should focus on simplified measures, instructions, and anchors for these younger children.], accnum: %q[20921070], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Tomlinson, D.", "von Baeyer, C.

With this in mind, the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of available QOL measures for people with intellectual disability (ID) to pinpoint psychometrically sound measures that can be routinely used for service evaluation. METHOD: A systematic search of the disability literature published between 1980 and 2008 was conducted in order to identify appropriate QOL tools for use within an Australian context. Twenty-four QOL instruments were identified and each instrument was then evaluated against a set of psychometric and measurement criteria. RESULTS: Six of the instruments examined were deemed to be psychometrically sound on the available information. No instruments were found that specifically assess QOL for people with ID who exhibit challenging behaviour. Most of the instruments assess QOL from a subjective perspective, use a questionnaire format and measure only some (not all) of the eight theoretically accepted domains of QOL. CONCLUSIONS: More instruments that measure QOL need to be developed and rigorously validated. This is especially the case for high-needs disability populations like those individuals that exhibit challenging behaviour or have severe to profound ID, as it is questionable whether existing measures can be used with these populations.], accnum: %q[21679329], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Townsend-White, C.", "Pham, A.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Question: What is the inter-rater reliability for measurements of passive physiological or accessory movements in lower extremity joints? Design: Systematic review of studies of inter-rater reliability. Participants: Individuals with and without lower extremity disorders. Outcome measures: Range of motion and end-feel using methods feasible in daily practice. Results: 17 studies were included of which 5 demonstrated acceptable inter-rater reliability. Reliability of measurements of physiological range of motion ranged from Kappa -0.02 for measuring knee extension using a goniometer to ICC 0.97 for measuring knee flexion using vision. Measuring range of knee flexion consistently yielded acceptable reliability using either vision or instruments. Measurements of end-feel were unreliable for all hip and knee movements. Two studies satisfied all criteria for internal validity while reporting acceptable reliability for measuring physiological range of knee flexion and extension. Overall, however, methodological quality of included studies was poor. Conclusion: Inter-rater reliability of measurement of passive movements in lower extremity joints is generally low. We provide specific recommendations for the conduct and reporting of future research. Awaiting new evidence, clinicians should be cautious when relying on results from measurements of passive movements in joints for making decisions about patients with lower extremity disorders.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcome is becoming important and of interest for clinicians and patients alike. HRQOL can be affected immediately after the initial diagnosis of the disease through anxiety of blindness. Further impairment in various aspects of HRQOL is expected over time as the disease progresses, reducing daily activities. Without a gold standard for HRQOL construct in this population, a number of instruments have become available with different characteristics and foci. This article reviews published HRQOL instruments and their psychometric properties in glaucoma patients. Of the 10 instruments reviewed, 2 were generic, 4 were vision-specific and 4 were glaucoma-specific instruments. Overall, vision- and glaucoma-specific instruments appear to be more sensitive than generic instruments in detecting potential changes of HRQOL in the patients. The shortcoming of existing instruments, however, arises from being predominantly focused on physical functions while omitting other aspects relevant to patients HRQOL such as psychological and social well-being. In addition, many vision-specific instruments have inadequate coverage of important issues, such as peripheral and color vision, which are affected by glaucoma disease. Validation of the instruments using various magnitudes of visual field is warranted and further investigation of their responsiveness is required for them to be more useful for outcome evaluation in the clinical setting.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: The paradigm shift from the clinically deficit-oriented approach to that of educationally strength-based model in assessing adolescents' psychosocial well-being has brought about a recent increase in school-based health promotion and prevention initiatives. This prompted this systematic review of measuring instruments designed to assess psychosocial well-being of children and adolescents. METHODS: Using electronic databases on Academic Search Premier, MEDLINE, PROQUEST, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus and Psychosocial and Health Instrument, a systematic review of literature of measuring instruments was conducted from their inception to December 2009 using the keywords of child, emotion, assessment, scale and measure. Measuring instruments from selected articles were critically appraised using a predetermined set of quality indicators which guided the rating of the psychometric properties of the instruments into grades of A, B, and C. The constructs of psychosocial well-being from the measuring instruments were categorized into themes. RESULTS: Twenty-nine out of the 908 articles met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen instruments identified from the selected articles were examined using preset quality indicators. In construct building, the themes identified from the strength-based instruments distinguished the construct of psychosocial well-being primarily into the dimensions of personal emotional competency and social functioning. In the ratings of psychometric properties, one instrument was rated 5A, five rated 4A and four rated 3A. For reliability testing, eight measures received grade A when their intraclass correlation is higher than 0.7; whereas only two instruments reported sensitivity and none investigated responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Strength-based measures focusing on social emotional behavioural outcomes open up a possibility to link up assessment with promotion of psychosocial well-being, away from clinical settings and into adolescents' homes, schools and community. Future research should focus more on investigating the sensitivity and responsiveness of measuring instruments using longitudinal design in efficacy studies to assess change in adolescents' psychosocial status over extended time.], accnum: %q[22168129], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Tsang, K.

RESULTS: In total, 68 relevant studies of the Turkish, Arab, and Surinamese populations were identified. To arrive at an appropriate cross-culturally adapted scale, five steps are required. Six studies followed this complete process. Only a few studies assessed all the psychometric properties of the cross-culturally adapted scales.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms are best assessed using patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments. Guidance on developing well-defined and reliable instruments that capture optimal information from the patient's perspective was recently published by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate existing PRO instruments for GERD symptoms with regard to regulatory requirements. Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed and Embase to identify PRO instruments for GERD symptoms that have undergone psychometric evaluation. Content, construct and test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and responsiveness were evaluated in relation to regulatory recommendations. Supplementary searches were conducted to assess whether identified instruments had been used as clinical trial endpoint measures. The systematic literature searches identified 15 PRO instruments for GERD symptoms that have undergone psychometric evaluation. Eight were designed to evaluate GERD symptoms, two were to diagnose GERD, four were designed for both evaluative and diagnostic purposes, and one was designed for screening purposes. Five instruments were developed and reported to include most steps recommended by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and have also been used as endpoint measures in clinical trials: the GERD Symptom Assessment Scale, the Nocturnal Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease Symptom Severity and Impact Questionnaire, the Reflux Questionnaire, the Reflux Disease Questionnaire, and the Proton pump inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom test.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The aim of this review was to summarize literature in view of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments for glaucoma and provide guidance on how outcomes are best assessed based on evidence about their content and validity. A systematic literature review was performed on papers describing the developmental process and/or psychometric properties of glaucoma or vision-specific PRO-instruments. Each of them was assessed on their adherence to a framework of quality criteria. Fifty-three articles were identified addressing 27 PRO-instruments. In all, 18 PRO's were developed for glaucoma and 9 for diverse ophthalmologic conditions. Seven instruments addressed functional status, 11 instruments quality of life and 9 instruments disease and treatment-related factors. Most of the instruments demonstrated only partially adherence to predefined quality standards. The tools for assessing functional status were of poor quality, while the Glaucoma Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Vision Quality of Life Index were well-developed QoL measures, yet only validated using classical techniques. The Rasch-scaled QoL-tools, IVI and VCM1 need to improve their item-content for glaucoma patients. The questionnaires to measure adherence should improve their validity and the Treatment Satisfaction Survey for Intra Ocular Pressure pops out as the highest quality tool for measuring topical treatment side effects. This review revealed that most PRO-instruments demonstrated poor developmental quality, more specifically a lack of conceptual framework and item generation strategies not involving the patients' perspective.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: Caring for someone with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can result in considerable consequences for the caregiver. Carers often experience a range of negative emotions, impacts upon their physical and mental health, as well as financial strain. Resultant from these impacts, carers utilise medical services at a higher rate than their non-caregiving counterparts. Further, these consequences of caregiving can also impact upon the patient, resulting in an increase in psychopathology and relapse. Although the notion of burden has been studied for approximately 60 years, many flaws and inadequacies remain; most notably, a lack of agreement on the definition of the construct along with the poor psychometric properties of the burden assessment instruments. METHOD: This article reviews and evaluates the measures of burden of care that have been utilised with carers of people with a serious mental illness. A systematic search was conducted and all articles that had measured burden of care in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in the database PUBMED were reviewed to ascertain the measure utilised. RESULTS: Ten different measures were subsequently identified and eight were reviewed; two were excluded on the basis that they had only been utilised once. CONCLUSIONS: It was apparent that many of the measures lacked a strong theoretical basis and sound psychometric properties. Further, some of the measures lacked utility, feasibility and specificity.

Three clinical tools were available which specifically evaluated trunk performance after stroke; the Trunk Control Test and two Trunk Impairment Scales. CONCLUSION: Ordinal single items or subscales of existing larger scales lack a systematic evaluation of psychometric characteristics. Both Trunk Impairment Scales have been extensively examined.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: Non-restorative sleep (NRS) is a core symptom of insomnia, typically defined as a subjective feeling of being unrefreshed upon awakening. NRS symptoms have been less consistently studied than other symptoms of insomnia, and there is no consensus regarding measurement of NRS. Given its subjective nature, patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments are important for evaluating NRS symptom severity and treatment-related changes. The objective of this literature review was to identify PROs used in insomnia populations that purport to measure NRS, and to evaluate their psychometric characteristics. METHODS: A comprehensive review of PRO instruments used in insomnia was conducted; instruments were reviewed for NRS content by two independent reviewers; a total of 26 instruments identified to contain NRS content were retained for further review. RESULTS: Of the 26 instruments reviewed, 23 contained at least one item evaluating subjective nighttime aspects of NRS; 17 contained at least one item evaluating daytime aspects of NRS. Only the Sleep Assessment Questionnaire contained a specific NRS domain score. However, little published evidence was available regarding measurement properties of the NRS domain in insomnia populations. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no reliable and well-validated PRO instrument available for specifically evaluating NRS symptom severity and response to interventions in insomnia populations.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: The need for an approach to measuring health results that incorporates patients' and payers' perspectives has generated a wide range of health care outcomes (HCOs), but it is yet unknown whether these HCOs are appropriate or valid for the health care decision-making process. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess HCOs, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and economic outcomes in terms of validity and appropriateness to health care decision making in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This systematic review of studies published between January 1, 1996, and November 1, 2010, comprised an electronic literature search of MEDLINE and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases. Studies included were clinical trials, observational studies, economic analyses, and studies on the development and validation of HCOs in T2DM in the adult population. HCOs were assessed and classified according to their relevance for decision makers in terms of feasibility for routine use, validity, sensitivity, reliability, understanding, and scope. RESULTS: Two independent reviewers screened 4497 citations. Of these, 281 potentially eligible full articles were retrieved, and 185 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 121 HCOs in T2DM were identified: 80 (66.1%) PROs and 41 (33.9%) economic outcomes. Only 44.6% of the outcomes assessed were appropriate and valid for health care decision making. Greater deficiencies in evidence were found for PROs (61.3%), followed by economic outcomes (43.9%). CONCLUSIONS: A large number of HCOs are being used in the health care decision-making process, but a significant proportion of these new outcomes have not been properly validated. Despite the fact that appropriate measures will depend on the specific needs of the decision makers, researchers need to use HCOs for which evidence of quality and appropriateness is available.], accnum: %q[21856000], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Vieta, A.", "Badia, X.", "Sacristan, J.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Delirium is a severe psychiatric syndrome that is highly prevalent in elderly general hospital patients. However, the diagnosis of delirium is often missed. The use of rating scales can be helpful in detecting and measuring delirium symptom severity. This article reviews recent developments regarding psychometric qualities, measurement goals, content and rating procedures of some of the available rating scales in clinical practice. Literature from the Medline files up to 2008 were collected, using the following search entries: delirium, (acute) confusion, assessment/rating scale and screening. Articles were selected if their title or summary were related to the development or applicability of delirium rating scales. The reference lists of relevant articles were searched for additional references. The rating scales were split up according to their purposes, screening or severity rating and were discussed for the following aspects: content (theoretical background, rating domains and items), interview (duration, format and assessors' expertise) and psychometric qualities (reliability and validity). There were eight screening scales (Confusion Assessment Method [CAM], CAM for the Intensive Care Unit [CAM-ICU], Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist [ICDSC], Delirium Symptom Interview [DSI], NEECHAM Confusion Scale [NEECHAM], Cognitive Test for Delirium [CTD], Delirium Observation Screening [DOS] and Nursing Delirium Screening Scale [Nu-DESC]) and seven severity rating scales (Delirium Rating Scales [DRS], Memorial Delirium Assessment Scales [MDAS], Confusional State Evaluation [CSE], Delirium Severity Scales [DSS], Delirium Index [DI], Delirium-O-Meter [DOM] and Delirium Detection Scale [DDS]) selected for further research. The CAM, NEECHAM and DOS and the CAM-ICU for the ICU appear to be the most suitable as screening instruments, depending on the type of rater (trained) physician or nurse. The (revised) Delirium Rating Scale (DRS-R-98) and the DOM appear to be particularly useful for measuring delirium severity or monitoring change.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE To summarize and critically appraise the evidence on the measurement properties of clinician-, patient-, and observer-reported outcomes, measuring any construct of interest in patients with all types of vitiligo. DATA SOURCES Electronic databases including PubMed (1948 to July 2011), OVID EMBASE (1980 to July 2011), and CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (1982 to July 2011) were searched. STUDY SELECTION Two authors independently screened all records for eligibility. For inclusion, the study population had to include patients with vitiligo, for which outcome measures were developed or evaluated on their measurement properties. The initial search retrieved 1249 records, of which 14 articles met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION Characteristics of the included instruments, study population, and results of the measurement properties were extracted. The Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) 4-point checklist, combined with quality criteria for measurement properties, was used to calculate the overall level of evidence per measurement property of each instrument. Independent extraction and assessment was performed by 2 authors. DATA SYNTHESIS Eleven different measurement instruments were identified. Strong evidence was found for a positive internal consistency of the Dermatology Life Quality Index. For other instruments, the evidence of measurement properties was limited or unknown. CONCLUSIONS Recommendations on the use of specific outcome measures for vitiligo should be formulated with caution because current evidence is insufficient owing to a low number of studies with poor methodological quality and unclear clinical relevance.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Women with cervical cancer now have relatively good 5-year survival rates. Better survival rates have driven the paradigm in cancer care from a medical illness model to a wellness model, which is concerned with the quality of women's lives as well as the length of survival. Thus, the assessment of quality of life among cervical cancer survivors is increasingly paramount for healthcare professionals. The purposes of this review were to describe existing validated quality of life instruments used in cervical cancer survivors, and to reveal the implications of quality of life measurement for Chinese cervical cancer survivors. METHODS: A literature search of five electronic databases was conducted using the terms cervical/cervix cancer, quality of life, survivors, survivorship, measurement, and instruments. Articles published in either English or Chinese from January 2000 to June 2009 were searched. Only those adopting an established quality of life instrument for use in cervical cancer survivors were included. RESULTS: A total of 11 validated multidimensional quality of life instruments were identified from 41 articles. These instruments could be classified into four categories: generic, cancer-specific, cancer site-specific and cancer survivor-specific instruments. With internal consistency varying from 0.68-0.99, the test-retest reliability ranged from 0.60-0.95 based on the test of the Pearson coefficient. One or more types of validity supported the construct validity. Although all these instruments met the minimum requirements of reliability and validity, the original versions of these instruments were mainly in English. CONCLUSION: Selection of an instrument should consider the purpose of investigation, take its psychometric properties into account, and consider the instrument's origin and comprehensiveness. As quality of life can be affected by culture, studies assessing the quality of life of cervical cancer survivors in China or other non-English speaking countries should choose or develop instruments relevant to their own cultural context. There is a need to develop a comprehensive quality of life instrument for Chinese cervical cancer survivors across the whole survivorship, including immediately after diagnosis and for short- (less than 5 years) and long-term (more than 5 years) survivorship.], accnum: %q[20302624], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Zeng, Y.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Pain is a common and major problem among nursing home residents. The prevalence of pain in elderly nursing home people is 40-80%, showing that they are at great risk of experiencing pain. Since assessment of pain is an important step towards the treatment of pain, there is a need for manageable, valid and reliable tools to assess pain in elderly people with dementia. METHODS: This systematic review identifies pain assessment scales for elderly people with severe dementia and evaluates the psychometric properties and clinical utility of these instruments. Relevant publications in English, German, French or Dutch, from 1988 to 2005, were identified by means of an extensive search strategy in Medline, Psychinfo and CINAHL, supplemented by screening citations and references. Quality judgement criteria were formulated and used to evaluate the psychometric aspects of the scales. RESULTS: Twenty-nine publications reporting on behavioural pain assessment instruments were selected for this review. Twelve observational pain assessment scales (DOLOPLUS2; ECPA; ECS; Observational Pain Behavior Tool; CNPI; PACSLAC; PAINAD; PADE; RaPID; Abbey Pain Scale; NOPPAIN; Pain assessment scale for use with cognitively impaired adults) were identified. Findings indicate that most observational scales are under development and show moderate psychometric qualities. CONCLUSION: Based on the psychometric qualities and criteria regarding sensitivity and clinical utility, we conclude that PACSLAC and DOLOPLUS2 are the most appropriate scales currently available.

Record.create(abstract: %q[There are numerous methods available for assessing patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other forms of dementia. Quality-of-life (QOL) assessment is unique among these methods, because the QOL concept itself includes a subjective component that is fundamental to its measurement. It could be argued that measuring quality of life is just as important as measuring disease severity, disease progression, symptom response, cognition, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living when assessing the impact of disease and intervention in dementia. The subjective nature of quality of life provides healthcare professionals with the opportunity of incorporating the value systems of patients and their carers into their assessments. A systematic review was carried out to include the published data (and some unpublished data) on QOL assessment tools and instruments that claim to measure quality of life in dementia. Literature for this review was identified by a thorough search of computer databases (1980-1997) that included Medline, Embase, PsychLit and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. Reports concerning the conceptualisation, development, validation, reliability, reproducibility, comprehensiveness, practicality and use of QOL instruments in dementia/AD were selected for review as well as papers documenting clinical drug trials in this therapeutic area. A number of measures or methods used in the literature for assessing the quality of life of patients with dementing illnesses were identified. It was decided to present the resulting review in 2 parts that correspond to the 2 main groups into which the instruments were categorised. The first (part 1) looks at measures used to assess the impact of disease as well as instruments at a developmental or testing stage. The second (part 2) includes instruments that claim to measure quality of life in studies documenting the impact of a drug in this therapeutic area. There are as yet no validated methods of assessing the quality of life of both patients with dementia and their carers at the same time. QOL outcomes for these 2 groups is closely, if not fundamentally, linked and yet most studies identified in this review concentrate on measuring the quality of life of either the patient or the carer alone. Although some researchers may be getting close conceptually, an instrument has yet to satisfy all the criteria necessary to become accepted as a gold standard for QOL assessment in dementing illness. The ideal instrument must show that it can reliably, reproducibly and comprehensively assess quality of life for patients with dementia and their carers. It should also demonstrate that it can measure quality of life effectively using a practical administration technique that does not place any unnecessary burden on either informal carers, other healthcare workers involved or the patient themselves. Further cross-sectional and longitudinal research is required to psychometrically test the available instruments as well as continuing conceptual research to explore new ways of assessing quality of life in this important area.], accnum: %q[10344915], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Walker, M.

Record.create(abstract: %q[In the past 20 years, there has been considerable growth in the number of knee instruments and rating scales designed to measure outcomes from the perspective of the patient. Only a few of these instruments have been evaluated for reliability, validity, and responsiveness. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the psychometric evidence of patient-reported outcome measures for the knee and identify the best scores for specific knee conditions. A literature search was performed to retrieve references relating to the development and evaluation of knee-specific instruments. Twenty-four unique instruments were identified, and most have satisfactory evidence for internal (alpha > or = 0.82) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient > or = 0.80). Face/content validity was typically assessed during the item selection process, and construct validity was evaluated through strict hypothesis testing or correlations with other clinical measures. For many instruments, effect sizes and standardized response means measuring responsiveness were large (> or = 0.80) within disease-specific populations. Based on the psychometric data, recommendations include the Cincinnati Knee Rating System, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm Knee Score for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, the Kujala Anterior Knee Pain Scale for anterior knee pain, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, KOOS, and Lysholm Knee Score for focal chondral defects, the Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool (WOMET) for meniscal injuries, and the KOOS for osteoarthritis (OA). Although the IKDC can be used as a general knee measure, no instrument is currently universally applicable across the spectrum of knee disorders and patient groups. Clinicians and researchers looking to use a patient-based score for measurement of outcomes must consider the specific patient population in which it has been evaluated.

We review studies reporting on consequences of thyroid disorders and present the frequency of identified aspects, both overall HRQL issues and classical thyroid symptoms, in order to evaluate which issues are relevant for patients with thyroid diseases. Furthermore, existing questionnaires for thyroid patients are reviewed. A systematic search was performed in the Medline, Cinahl and Psycinfo databases and the reference lists of the relevant articles were hand-searched. Seventy-five relevant studies were identified. According to these studies, patients with untreated thyroid disease suffer from a wide range of symptoms and have major impairment in most areas of HRQL. Furthermore, the studies indicate that impairments in HRQL are also frequent in the long term. Six HRQL questionnaires for thyroid patients were identified. Generally, data supporting the validity of these questionnaires were sparse. According to the available literature, the quality of life of thyroid patients is substantially impaired over a wide range of aspects of HRQL in the untreated phase and continues to be so in many patients also in the long term.

Record.create(abstract: %q[We sought to identify instruments assessing sleep quality that measure the domains of sleep applicable to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and are feasible to use and have appropriate reliability, validity, and responsiveness properties. A systematic review of sleep instruments was conducted. In particular, domains related to sleep that were assessed in the instruments were identified and evaluated. Feasibility characteristics and psychometric properties of instruments were reviewed. At OMERACT 9, the preparatory work was described at the plenary session of the Patient Perspective Workshop, and the tasks of 3 breakout groups in ranking and scoring the domains and sleep instruments were outlined. Each breakout group considered different aspects of sleep: sleep domains, feasibility, and psychometric properties. The rapporteur for each breakout group reported back to the plenary on the domains and sleep instruments that achieved the highest rank/score. The systematic review identified 45 sleep instruments of interest. Based on these instruments, 14 domains of sleep were identified. The top ranked domains were: Sleep Adequacy (1), Sleep Maintenance (2), Sleep Initiation (3) and Daytime Functioning (4). The top ranked instruments on feasibility were: Athens Insomnia Scale (2.3), Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Sleep (4.0), Insomnia Severity Index (4.9), and Women's Health Insomnia Rating Scale (5.5). The highest scored instruments on psychometric properties were: Athens Insomnia Scale (13.6), Sleep Assessment Questionnaire (13), Pittsburgh Sleep Diary (12), and MOS Sleep (11).

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: Assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of cancer patients with cachexia is particularly important because treatments for cachexia are currently aimed at palliation and treatment efficacy must be measured in ways other than survival. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate HRQOL assessment in cancer patients with cachexia. METHODS: Using guidance from the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, relevant databases were searched from January 1980 to January 2012 with terms relating to cancer, cachexia and HRQOL for papers including adult cancer patients with cachexia or documented weight loss at baseline. RESULTS: We found one cachexia-specific instrument, the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy, but the tool has not been fully validated, does not cover all the relevant domains and the consensus-based standards for the selection of health status measurement instruments checklist highlighted a number of weaknesses in the methodological quality of the validation study. Sixty-seven studies assessed HRQOL in cachectic or weight-losing cancer patients. Most used generic cancer HRQOL instruments, limiting the amount of useful information they provide. A modified version of the Efficace minimum data checklist demonstrated that the quality of reporting on HRQOL tool use was inadequate in many of the studies. A negative relationship between HRQOL and weight loss was found in 23 of the 27 studies which directly examined this.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Fatigue is a common symptom associated with a wide range of chronic diseases. A large number of instruments have been developed to measure fatigue. An assessment regarding the reliability, validity, and utility of fatigue measures is time-consuming for the clinician and researcher, and few reviews exist on which to draw such information. The aim of this article is to present a critical review of fatigue measures, the populations in which the scales have been used, and the extent to which the psychometric properties of each instrument have been evaluated to provide clinicians and researchers with information on which to base decisions. Seven databases were searched for all articles that measured fatigue and offered an insight into the psychometric properties of the scales used over the period 1980-2007. Criteria for judging the "ideal" measure were developed to encompass scale usability, clinical/research utility, and the robustness of psychometric properties. Twenty-two fatigue measures met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. A further 17 measures met some of the criteria, but have not been tested beyond initial development, and are reviewed briefly at the end of the article. The review did not identify any instrument that met all the criteria of an ideal instrument. However, a small number of short instruments demonstrated good psychometric properties (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS], Fatigue Impact Scale [FIS], and Brief Fatigue Inventory [BFI]), and three comprehensive instruments demonstrated the same (Fatigue Symptom Inventory [FSI], Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue [MAF], and Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory [MFSI]). Only four measures (BFI, FSS, FSI, and MAF) demonstrated the ability to detect change over time.

Record.create(abstract: %q[STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVES: Review the use of generic preference-based measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) within the context of spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify SCI-related publications that contained any of the following preference-based HRQoL instruments: 15D, Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-4D, AQoL-6D, EQ-5D, EQ-5D-5L, Health Utilities Index (HUI)-2, HUI-3, Quality of Well-Being Scale Self-Administered (QWB-SA), SF-6D(SF-36) or SF-6D(SF-12). In addition to providing an overview of how different preference-based measures have been adopted in SCI research to-date, a focus of evaluation was to collate and appraise evidence for measurement properties and identify knowledge gaps. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were identified. No studies have used preference-based measures in their conventional form, that is, to calculate quality-adjusted life years using patient-level data. Eleven papers reported mean utility scores (across six different instruments). Directly comparable data exists for only one SCI-specific sample, which showed variation across EQ-5D (0.63), HUI-2 (0.81) and HUI-3 (0.68) index scores. Indirect comparisons suggested differences between QWB-SA and SF-6D index scores within tetraplegic and paraplegic patient groups. Only the QWB-SA and SF-6D have undergone (partial) psychometric evaluation, with the respective authors concluding that the measures have potential for SCI research. CONCLUSIONS: Despite 'cost-effectiveness' being an increasingly important consideration for decision makers in all areas of health care, there is a distinct lack of conceptual or empirical research regarding the appropriateness of alternative preference-based HRQoL measures for SCI populations.

METHODS: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) between 1980 and December 2006 were conducted for peer-reviewed studies that evaluated self-report work outcome measures for patients with musculoskeletal disorders. The eligibility criteria for the papers included in the review were articles that: (1) discussed the psychometric evaluation of a self-reported health-related work outcome measure, (2) were conducted with patients who were diagnosed with musculoskeletal disorders, (3) were written as peer-reviewed full published reports, and (4) were published in English. Three pairs of reviewers used a modified rating form and evaluated the quality of the psychometric properties of the instruments described in the retrieved articles. RESULTS: Of the 740 articles that were identified, six instruments in eight studies met the inclusion criteria. None of the instruments demonstrated satisfactory results for all properties. Overall, the highest quality ratings were given to the Functional Abilities Confidence Scale and the Occupational Role Questionnaire.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature evaluating the reliability and validity of all available methods for measuring active and passive cervical range of motion (CROM). METHODS: Electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and AMED) were searched through OVID from their inception to January 2008. Articles were selected according to a priori defined criteria. Data were extracted regarding publication details, type of study, movements and device evaluated, subject and observer characteristics, and measurement protocol including blinding and statistical analysis methods. Quality assessment was undertaken using developed criteria to assess internal validity, external validity, and statistical methods. An estimate of the level of reliability and validity was calculated and used to categorize studies as good, moderate, or poor. RESULTS: A total of 56 articles fulfilled the selection criteria and were included in the review. Forty-six of these articles described 66 reliability studies and 21 described 21 concurrent criterion validity studies. Twelve different methods were evaluated. Although it was the intention of this review to conduct meta-analysis, this was deemed inappropriate due to studies being too heterogeneous. Most of the reliability and validity studies involved asymptomatic subjects measured by allied health professionals investigating active ROM. Devices that were deemed to have "good" reliability and validity were the CROM device, the Spin-T goniometer, and the single inclinometer. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of reliability and concurrent validity studies have been published for CROM. The CROM device has undergone most evaluation and has been shown to be clinimetrically sound.

This paper systematically reviews the psychometric rigour of resilience measurement scales developed for use in general and clinical populations. METHODS: Eight electronic abstract databases and the internet were searched and reference lists of all identified papers were hand searched. The focus was to identify peer reviewed journal articles where resilience was a key focus and/or is assessed. Two authors independently extracted data and performed a quality assessment of the scale psychometric properties. RESULTS: Nineteen resilience measures were reviewed; four of these were refinements of the original measure. All the measures had some missing information regarding the psychometric properties. Overall, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Brief Resilience Scale received the best psychometric ratings. The conceptual and theoretical adequacy of a number of the scales was questionable. CONCLUSION: We found no current 'gold standard' amongst 15 measures of resilience.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the psychometric evidence for sexual health outcome measures used in a SCI population in order to (1) determine the clinical relevance of current tools and (2) suggest recommendations for future tool development. SETTING: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for articles reporting psychometric properties of sexual health outcome measures used in a SCI population. The search was limited to papers published between January 1986 and January 2006. Hand-searching the references of papers obtained from the electronic search identified additional articles. RESULTS: Four outcome measures met the search criteria: Emotional Quality of the Relationship Scale (EQR), Sexual Activity and Satisfaction Scale (SAS), Sexual Attitude and Information Questionnaire (SAIQ) and Sexual Interest and Satisfaction Scale (SIS).

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Sound measurement properties of outcome tools are essential when evaluating outcomes of an intervention, in clinical practice and in research. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to review the evidence on reliability, measurement error, and responsiveness of measures of gait function in children with neuromuscular diagnoses. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched up to June 15, 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Studies evaluating reliability, measurement error, or responsiveness of measures of gait function in 1- to 18-year-old children and youth with neuromuscular diagnoses were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Quality of the studies was independently rated by 2 raters using a modified COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. Studies with a fair quality rating or better were considered for best evidence synthesis. DATA SYNTHESIS: Regarding the methodological quality, 32 out of 35 reliability studies, all of the 13 measurement error studies, and 5 out of 10 responsiveness studies were of fair or good quality. Best evidence synthesis revealed moderate to strong evidence for reliability for several measures in children and youth with cerebral palsy (CP) but was limited or unknown in other diagnoses. The Functional Mobility Scale (FMS) and the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) dimension E showed limited positive evidence for responsiveness in children with CP, but it was unknown or controversial in other diagnoses. No information was reported on the minimal important change; thus, evidence on measurement error remained undetermined. LIMITATIONS: As studies on validity were not included in the review, a comprehensive appraisal of the best available gait-related outcome measure per diagnosis is not possible. CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate to strong evidence on reliability for several measures of gait function in children and youth with CP, whereas evidence on responsiveness exists only for the FMS and the GMFM dimension E.], accnum: %q[24786947], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Ammann-Reiffer, C.", "Bastiaenen, C.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To identify valid and reliable outcome measures reflective of "real-life" active and passive function for application following focal rehabilitation interventions in the hemiparetic upper limb after stroke or brain injury. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature, incorporating a wide-based search including electronic databases, primary reports, abstracts and conference proceedings, was undertaken to identify measures, followed by a literature-based evaluation of the psychometric properties. RESULTS: Six measures met the review selection criteria, although 4 were different versions of the Motor Activity Log. None of the measures met all the psychometric evaluation criteria. The tools effectively formed a hierarchy with the ABILHAND and Motor Activity Log representing quite thoroughly evaluated tools of higher level "active function". The Leeds Adult Spasticity Impact Scale addressed lower level tasks and passive function, but had little published psychometric evaluation. CONCLUSION: As yet there is no single valid and reliable outcome measure available to capture the full range of "real-life" function in the hemiparetic upper limb. Validated tools are particularly required for passive and lower level function.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This paper aimed to select studies evaluating botulinum toxin (BoNT) intervention applied for upper-limb spasticity and from these identify outcome measures that are a) applicable in the hemiparetic upper limb and b) include evaluation of functional outcome in the context of everyday real-life activities. METHODS: A systematic search was used to identify peer-reviewed papers evaluating BoNT intervention for focal spasticity management in the upper limb. From these papers, outcome evaluation methods were identified, which attempted to capture 'active function' improvement (functional use of the hand and/or arm) or passive function improvement (care for the affected limb, for example to maintain hygiene and dress or support the arm). RESULTS: The search yielded 411 studies. Seventy papers were identified following a final review of the abstracts as potentially including evaluation of functional outcome (active and/or passive function). Following the review of the papers, a total of 22 studies contained specific methods for evaluating functional outcome in the upper limb. DISCUSSION: Three different patient-focused methods to evaluate functional outcome following focal spasticity intervention using BoNT have been identified: 1) use of patient report of upper-limb items (including the Leeds Adult Spasticity Impact Scale and the Disability Assessment Scale), 2) use of a composite measure of function incorporating functional items and 3) Goal Attainment Scaling. None of these methods fully address evaluation of functional outcome in this context but may go some way to recording these improvements. An alternative or complementary measure, recently published, is the Arm Activity Measure for evaluation of active and passive function in this context. The Arm Activity Measure addresses active and passive function changes from the perspective of patients and carers and has been developed for application in this context.], accnum: %q[23630050], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Ashford, S.", "Turner-Stokes, L."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Diseases of and symptoms related to the nervous system"], doi: %q[10.1002/pri.1554], endnum: %q[352], fs: ["Physical functioning"], ghp: [], id: 485, instrument: [], issn: %q[1471-2865 (Electronic)], issue: %q[3], journal: %q[Physiother Res Int], oql: [], pnp: [], pubyear: %q[2013], ss: [], startpage: %q[178-89], status: %q[published], title: %q[Systematic review of upper-limb function measurement methods in botulinum toxin intervention for focal spasticity], tmi: [], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23630050"])

This systematic review evaluates the clinimetric properties of visual perception assessments for children with hemiplegia. METHOD: Databases were searched for assessments that: (i) measured visual perception; (ii) were reported in studies with children with hemiplegia and (iii) had clinimetric data available to assessors. RESULTS: Three assessments met criteria: the Test of Visual Perceptual Skills (TVPS), Motor-Free Visual Perceptual Test (MVPT) and Developmental Test of Visual Perception (DTVP). Factor analysis has been completed for the TVPS and DTVP, with both assessments and especially the TVPS, demonstrating some subtests that do not load significantly for the first factor of motor-free visual perception. All three assessments demonstrate variable construct and criterion validity with other clinical assessments. The DTVP, MVPT and TVPS demonstrate high test-retest reliability for total scores, but individual TVPS subtests are less reliable. CONCLUSIONS: The MVPT and DTVP show the best clinimetric data, however, less research has been completed on these tests than the TVPS.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: A wide array of instruments are available for non-invasive thoracic kyphosis measurement. Guidelines for selecting outcome measures for use in clinical and research practice recommend that properties such as validity and reliability are considered. This systematic review reports on the reliability and validity of non-invasive methods for measuring thoracic kyphosis. METHODS: A systematic search of 11 electronic databases located studies assessing reliability and/or validity of non-invasive thoracic kyphosis measurement techniques. Two independent reviewers used a critical appraisal tool to assess the quality of retrieved studies. Data was extracted by the primary reviewer. The results were synthesized qualitatively using a level of evidence approach. RESULTS: 27 studies satisfied the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The reliability, validity and both reliability and validity were investigated by sixteen, two and nine studies respectively. 17/27 studies were deemed to be of high quality. In total, 15 methods of thoracic kyphosis were evaluated in retrieved studies. All investigated methods showed high (ICC >/= .7) to very high (ICC >/= .9) levels of reliability. The validity of the methods ranged from low to very high. CONCLUSION: The strongest levels of evidence for reliability exists in support of the Debrunner kyphometer, Spinal Mouse and Flexicurve index, and for validity supports the arcometer and Flexicurve index.

The Oral Rehabilitation Outcomes Network (ORONet) conducted two international workshops to develop a core set of outcome measures, including a functional domain. The process followed the general format used in the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) workshops to develop consensus for clinical outcome measures in arthritis research, which included: developing a comprehensive list of potential outcomes in the literature; submitting them to a filter for validity, clinical discrimination, and feasibility; and ranking those measures meeting all the filter criteria for relative value. The search was conducted to include functional assessments of speech, swallowing, mastication, nutrition, sensation, and motor function as they relate to dental implant therapies. This literature review surveyed 173 papers that produced some result of these descriptors in the functional domain. Of these, 67 papers reported on functional assessments and further defined objective and subjective outcomes. Many of these results were patient-perceived improvements in function, while others were objective assessments based on established methodologies and instruments. Objective evaluations of masticatory function and speech may meet criteria for validity and discriminability for selected interventions, but are generally not feasible for routine use in clinical care settings.

This paper identifies QoL measures for people with dementia and assesses their properties. METHOD: A systematic narrative review identified articles using dementia QoL measures. Electronic databases searched were AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, Index to Theses, IBSS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science. All available years and languages (if with an English language abstract) were included. RESULTS: Searches yielded 6806 citations; 3043 were multiple duplicates (759 being true duplicates).

Some referenced Lawton's model (Dementia Quality of Life [DQOL] and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease [QOL-AD]), though these tapped part of this only; others claimed relationship to a health-related QoL concept (e.g. DEMQOL), though had less social relevance; others were based on limited domains (e.g. activity, affect) or clinical opinions (Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia [QUALID]). Many measures were based on proxy assessments or observations of people with dementia's QoL, rather than their own ratings. The Bath Assessment of Subjective Quality of Life in Dementia (BASQID) was developed involving people with dementia and caregivers, but excluded some of their main themes. All measures were tested on selective samples only (ranging from community to hospital clinics, or subsamples/waves of existing population surveys), in a few sites.

METHODS: Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched from inception to October 2012. Search terms pertained to gout, health or functional status, clinimetric properties and HRQOL. Study data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: From 474 identified studies, 22 met the inclusion criteria. Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and Short Form 36 (SF-36) were most frequently used and highest rated due to robust construct and concurrent validity, despite high floor and ceiling effects. The Gout Impact Scale had good content validity. Gout had a greater impact on physical HRQOL compared to other domains. Both gout-specific features (attack frequency and intensity, intercritical pain and number of joints involved) and comorbid disease were associated with poor HRQOL. Evidence for objective features such as tophi and serum uric acid was less robust. Limitations of existing studies include cross-sectional design, recruitment from specialist clinic settings and frequent use of generic instruments. CONCLUSION: Most studies have used the generic HAQ-DI and SF-36. Gout-specific characteristics and comorbidities contribute to poor HRQOL.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Social inclusion is crucial to mental health and well-being and is emphasised in Australia's Fourth National Mental Health Plan. There is a recognition that a measure of social inclusion would complement the suite of outcome measures that is currently used in public sector mental health services. This paper is an initial scope of candidate measures of social inclusion and considers their suitability for this purpose. METHODS: We identified potential measures through searches of PsycINFO and Medline and a more general Internet search. We extracted descriptive and evaluative information on each measure identified and compared this information with a set of eight criteria. The criteria related to the measure's inclusion of four domains of social inclusion outlined in Australia's Fourth National Mental Health Plan, its usability within the public mental health sector and its psychometric properties. RESULTS: We identified 10 candidate measures of social inclusion: the Activity and Participation Questionnaire (APQ-6); the Australian Community Participation Questionnaire (ACPQ); the Composite Measure of Social Inclusion (CMSI); the EMILIA Project Questionnaire (EPQ); the Evaluating Social Inclusion Questionnaire (ESIQ); the Inclusion Web (IW); the Social and Community Opportunities Profile (SCOPE); the Social Inclusion Measure (SIM); the Social Inclusion Questionnaire (SIQ); and the Staff Survey of Social Inclusion (SSSI). After comparison with the eight review criteria, we determined that the APQ-6 and the SCOPE-short form show the most potential for further testing. CONCLUSIONS: Social inclusion is too important not to measure. This discussion of individual-level measures of social inclusion provides a springboard for selecting an appropriate measure for use in public sector mental health services. It suggests that there are two primary candidates, but neither of these is quite fit-for-purpose in their current form.

This systematic review compares the psychometric properties and content of questionnaires for assessment of sexual functioning in patients using antipsychotics. A systematic literature search was performed using three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO) with predefined search terms. We identified six validated instruments for assessment of sexual functioning in patients using antipsychotics: the Antipsychotic Non-Neurological Side Effects Rating Scale (ANNSERS), the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), the Antipsychotics and Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (ASFQ), the Changes in Sexual Function Questionnaire-14 (CSFQ-14), the Nagoya Sexual Function Questionnaire (NSFQ), and the Psychotropic-Related Sexual Dysfunction Questionnaire (PRSexDQ). The ASFQ, CSFQ-14, and PRSexDQ cover all stages of sexual functioning, which makes these questionnaires preferable to the other three questionnaires described. The ASFQ and PRSexDQ are clinician-administered and ask for a change in sexual functioning related to medication. The ASFQ assesses improvement as well as deterioration of sexual functioning, and includes items about hyperprolactinemia.

Record.create(abstract: %q[There is a growing appetite for mental health and wellbeing outcome measures that can inform clinical practice at individual and service levels, including use for local and national benchmarking. Despite a varied literature on child mental health and wellbeing outcome measures that focus on psychometric properties alone, no reviews exist that appraise the availability of psychometric evidence and suitability for use in routine practice in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) including key implementation issues. This paper aimed to present the findings of the first review that evaluates existing broadband measures of mental health and wellbeing outcomes in terms of these criteria. The following steps were implemented in order to select measures suitable for use in routine practice: literature database searches, consultation with stakeholders, application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, secondary searches and filtering. Subsequently, detailed reviews of the retained measures' psychometric properties and implementation features were carried out. 11 measures were identified as having potential for use in routine practice and meeting most of the key criteria: 1) Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, 2) Beck Youth Inventories, 3) Behavior Assessment System for Children, 4) Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale, 5) Child Health Questionnaire, 6) Child Symptom Inventories, 7) Health of the National Outcome Scale for Children and Adolescents, 8) Kidscreen, 9) Pediatric Symptom Checklist, 10) Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, 11) Youth Outcome Questionnaire. However, all existing measures identified had limitations as well as strengths. Furthermore, none had sufficient psychometric evidence available to demonstrate that they could reliably measure both severity and change over time in key groups.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: In order to make inferences about strength related to development or treatment interventions, it is important to use measurement instruments that have sound clinimetric properties. PURPOSE: The objective of this review is to systematically evaluate the level of evidence of the clinimetric properties of instruments for measuring upper extremity muscle strength at the "body functions & structures" level of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY) for children with cerebral palsy (CP). DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, OTseeker, CINAHL, PEDro, and MEDLINE databases up to November 2012 was performed. STUDY SELECTION: Two independent raters identified and examined studies that reported the use of upper extremity strength measurement instruments and methods for children and adolescents with CP aged 0 to 18 years. DATA EXTRACTION: The COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments) checklist with 4-point rating scale was used by 2 independent raters to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. Best evidence synthesis was performed using COSMIN outcomes and the quality of the clinimetric properties. DATA SYNTHESIS: Six different measurement instruments or methods were identified. Test-retest, interrater, and intrarater reliability were investigated. Two test-retest reliability studies were rated as "fair" for the level of evidence. All other studies were rated as "unknown" for the level of evidence. LIMITATIONS: The paucity of literature describing clinimetric properties, especially other than reliability, of upper limb strength measurement instruments for children with CP was a limitation of the study. CONCLUSIONS: For measuring grip strength, the Jamar dynamometer is recommended. For other muscle groups, handheld dynamometry is recommended. Manual muscle testing (MMT) can be used in case of limited (below MMT grade 4) wrist strength or for total upper limb muscle strength.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: Advancing technology allows for successful treatment of children with life-threatening illnesses. Effectively assessing and optimally treating a child's distress during their stay in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is paramount. Objective measures of distress in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients are increasingly available but few have been evaluated. The objectives of this systematic review were to identify available instruments appropriate for measuring physiological and behavioral cues of pain, non-pain related distress, and adequacy of analgesia and sedation in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients, and evaluate these instruments in terms of their psychometric properties. DESIGN: A systematic review of original and validation reports of objective instruments to measure pain and non-pain related distress, and adequacy of analgesia and sedation in mechanically ventilated PICU patients was undertaken. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search was conducted in 10 databases from January 1970 to June 2011. Reference lists of relevant articles were reviewed to identify additional articles. REVIEW METHODS: Studies were included in the review if they met pre-established eligibility criteria. Two independent reviewers reviewed studies for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted data. RESULTS: Twenty-five articles were included, identifying 15 instruments. The instruments had different foci including: assessing pain, non-pain related distress, and sedation (n=2); assessing pain exclusively (n=4); assessing sedation exclusively (n=7), assessing sedation in mechanically ventilated muscle relaxed PICU patients (n=1); and assessing delirium in mechanically ventilated PICU patients (n=1). The Comfort Scale demonstrated the greatest clinical utility in the assessment of pain, non-pain related distress, and sedation in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients. Modified FLACC and the MAPS are more appropriate, however, for the assessment of procedural pain and other brief painful events. More work is required on instruments for the assessment of distress in mechanically ventilated muscle relaxed PICU patients, and the assessment of delirium in PICU patients. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides essential information to guide PICU clinicians in choosing instruments to assess pain, non-pain related distress, and adequacy of analgesia and sedation in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: The assessment of outcomes from the patient's perspective becomes more recognized in health care. Also in patients with chronic ankle instability, the degree of present impairments, disabilities and participation problems should be documented from the perspective of the patient. The decision about which patient-assessed instrument is most appropriate for clinical practice should be based upon systematic reviews. Only rating scales constructed for patients with acute ligament injuries were systematically reviewed in the past. The aim of this study was to review systematically the clinimetric qualities of patient-assessed instruments designed for patients with chronic ankle instability. METHODS: A computerized literature search of Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Sport Discus and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register was performed to identify eligible instruments. Two reviewers independently evaluated the clinimetric qualities of the selected instruments using a criteria list. The inter-observer reliability of both the selection procedure and the clinimetric evaluation was calculated using modified kappa coefficients. RESULTS: The inter-observer reliability of the selection procedure was excellent (k = .86). Four instruments met the eligibility criteria: the Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool (AJFAT), the Functional Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and the Functional Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM). The inter-observer reliability of the quality assessment was substantial to excellent (k between .64 and .88). Test-retest reliability was demonstrated for the FAOS, the FADI and the FAAM but not for the AJFAT. The FAOS and the FAAM met the criteria for content validity and construct validity. For none of the studied instruments, the internal consistency was sufficiently demonstrated. The presence of floor- and ceiling effects was assessed for the FAOS but ceiling effects were present for all subscales. Responsiveness was demonstrated for the AJFAT, FADI and the FAAM. Only for the FAAM, a minimal clinical important difference (MCID) was presented. CONCLUSION: The FADI and the FAAM can be considered as the most appropriate, patient-assessed tools to quantify functional disabilities in patients with chronic ankle instability. The clinimetric qualities of the FAAM need to be further demonstrated in a specific population of patients with chronic ankle instability.], accnum: %q[17233912], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Eechaute, C.", "Vaes, P.", "Van Aerschot, L.", "Asman, S.", "Duquet, W."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes"], doi: %q[10.1186/1471-2474-8-6], endnum: %q[402], fs: ["Physical functioning"], ghp: [], id: 500, instrument: [], issn: %q[1471-2474 (Electronic)], journal: %q[BMC Musculoskelet Disord], oql: [], pnp: ["Patient Reported Outcome"], pubyear: %q[2007], ss: [], startpage: %q[6], status: %q[published], title: %q[The clinimetric qualities of patient-assessed instruments for measuring chronic ankle instability: a systematic review], tmi: ["6 - Clinical rating scales"], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17233912", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1797175/"])

The Test of Sensory Function in Infants is a performance-based assessment and is suitable for infants aged 4 to 18 months. Studies evaluating the psychometric properties of these three assessments differed in the properties addressed and reported poor to adequate reliability.

DATA SOURCES: The databases consulted for the literature research were MEDLINE, PEDro, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL). The search was carried out between March 2011 and January 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that describe and validate a measurement scale designed to assess gross motor function in stroke. The articles were classified according to the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation for diagnosis studies of the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. DATA EXTRACTION: General characteristics of the studies, including number of patients, motor function assessment scales analyzed, and their psychometric properties, were collected.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: To identify and study the psychometric properties of the most used health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) instruments in men with prostate cancer. METHODS: We performed a literature search using PubMed and EMBASE to identify all studies on prostate cancer using a HRQoL instrument. The most often used HRQoL instruments were investigated in detail by 2 independent reviewers. Data were extracted regarding the characteristics and psychometric values of the instruments, i.e., content validity, internal consistency, criterion validity, construct validity, reproducibility, responsiveness, floor and ceiling effects, and interpretability. Good psychometric outcomes indicate a high methodological quality of the instrument. RESULTS: Our systematic search revealed 13,812 potential relevant articles, of which 2,258 appeared relevant after screening the titles and reading the abstracts. We studied the psychometric properties of the 20 most often used HRQoL instruments, the first 3 of which were the Expanded Prostate Index Composite, University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index, and Short Form-36 (SF-36). Content validity, internal consistency (alpha>0.70), criterion validity, construct validity, and reproducibility were good in 60%, 90%, 10%, 35%, and 65% of the 20 instruments, respectively. Responsiveness was not reported for 12 of 20 instruments (60%). Floor and ceiling effects and the interpretability of the questionnaires were only reported in 3 (15%) and 6 (30%) instruments.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: High blood pressure (HBP) self-care is critical for the control of HBP. Adequate measurement of HBP self-care is a necessary first step toward ameliorating the global pandemic of HBP. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to identify, describe, and critique existing HBP self-care instruments. The degree of adequacy of these instruments was evaluated against well-established behavioral guidelines for HBP care. METHODS: This review was limited to articles published in English before October 2012. In addition, the following criteria were used: (1) the study described the validity and/or the reliability of a self-care/self-management instrument and (2) the study targeted patients with hypertension. Electronic database searches identified 1701 potentially relevant articles. Two authors reviewed the titles and the abstracts of all the retrieved articles independently. On the basis of the inclusion and the exclusion criteria, as well as cross-referencing, 29 articles were included in this review. RESULTS: From the 29 articles, 19 unique HBP self-care instruments were identified (some were modified or translated versions of an original measure). Medication taking, a key domain of HBP self-care, was the main focus of 12 of the 19 instruments. Other key domains of HBP self-care were often missing or omitted. Seven instruments measured multiple dimensions of self-care; however, these either failed to capture all the main HBP self-care domains or had poor psychometric profiles. Nineteen of the 29 articles reported both validity and reliability, with varying degrees of rigor. CONCLUSIONS: The current assessment tools do not capture all the critical elements of HBP self-care. The few instruments that attempted to measure the multiple behavioral dimensions of HBP self-care failed to report adequate levels of psychometric properties of those domains because of their incompleteness. Challenges remain in translating the HBP self-care guidelines into effective intervention and relevant assessment tools. Developing a valid and reliable instrument that captures the multidimensional nature of HBP self-care is urgently needed.], accnum: %q[23348221], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Han, H.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: When judging the success or failure of major lower extremity (MLE) amputation, the assessment of appropriate functional and quality of life (QOL) outcomes is paramount. The heterogeneity of the scales and tests in the current literature is confusing and makes it difficult to compare results. We provide a primer for outcome assessment after amputation and assess the need for the additional development of novel instruments. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were searched for all studies using functional and QOL instruments after MLE amputation. Assessment instruments were divided into functional and QOL categories. Within each category, they were subdivided into global and amputation-specific instruments. An overall assessment of instrument quality was obtained. RESULTS: The initial search revealed 746 potential studies. After a review of abstracts, 102 were selected for full review, and 40 studies were then included in this review. From the studies, 21 different assessment instruments were used 63 times. There were 14 (67%) functional measures and 7 (33%) QOL measures identified. Five (36%) of the functional instruments and 3 (43%) of the QOL measures were specific for MLE amputees. Sixteen instruments were used >1 time, but only 5 instruments were used >3 times. An additional 5 instruments were included that were deemed important by expert opinion. The 26 assessment instruments were rated. Fourteen of the best-rated instruments were then described. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of instruments used to measure both functional and QOL outcomes make it difficult to compare MLE amputation outcome studies. Future researchers should seek to use high-quality instruments. Clinical and research societies should endorse the best validated instruments for future use in order to strengthen overall research in the field.], accnum: %q[24495325], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Hawkins, A.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in children is characterized by persistent or recurrent debilitating fatigue which results in a substantial reduction in activity. There is a growing interest in the use of questionnaires, or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), to assess how patients function and feel in relation to their health and associated healthcare. However, guidance for PROM selection for children with CFS/ME does not exist. We reviewed the quality and acceptability of PROMs used with children with CFS/ME to inform recommendations for practice. We conducted a systematic review of PROMs completed by children with CFS/ME. The quality of the evaluative studies and the reviewed measures were assessed against recommended criteria using an appraisal framework and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. We sought evidence of measurement (reliability, validity, responsiveness, interpretability, data quality) and practical properties (acceptability, relevance, feasibility). Sixteen articles were included in the review, providing evidence of reliability and/or validity for 13 PROMs. Of these, five were child-specific (one health-related quality-of-life; four emotional well-being) and eight were not (four emotional well-being, three fatigue-specific; and one generic). All measures had limited evidence of measurement properties and no evidence of practical properties. Recommendations for patient-reported assessment are difficult to make because of limited evidence of the quality and acceptability of PROMs for children with CFS/ME. The appraisal method highlighted significant methodological and quality issues which must be addressed in future research. There is a lack of qualitative evidence describing the outcomes of healthcare that are important to children with CFS/ME, and the relevance or appropriateness of available measures. Future PROM development and evaluation in this group must seek to involve children collaboratively to ensure that the outcomes that children care about are assessed in an acceptable way.], accnum: %q[24661148], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Haywood, K.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Sleep is a dynamic and essential part of human life and health. In healthcare settings, nurses are strategically placed to promote sleep and sleep health. In this regard, nursing actions should be based upon effective methods of assessment of patient sleep. Standardised sleep assessment does not currently occur in the care of acute hospitalised patients. Use of an appropriate measurement tool would help evaluate inpatient sleep. An effective, efficient sleep assessment tool is needed to aid clinicians. Such assessment would enable specific nursing intervention to be tailored to individual patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to examine the literature on sleep measurement to identify subjective sleep assessment tools that may be suitable for routine use with hospitalised patients, and to evaluate their reliability and validity. METHOD: A review of existing literature was undertaken to identify and evaluate subjective sleep measurement tools. RESULTS: The initial literature searches identified 402 articles, of which ten met the criteria for review. These reported on three subjective sleep measurement scales: the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire; the St Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire; and the Verran Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale. The Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire is brief and easy to use. In specific samples, its items correlate with domains reflecting sleep quality and has shown excellent internal consistency. Equivocal results and scoring challenges were found with the St Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire. The Verran Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale captured sleep disturbance and total sleep time, but time-to-complete is more burdensome than the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The current use of sleep assessment instruments in the acute hospital setting is restricted mainly to research activities. Of the three tools identified that could be used clinically to measure inpatient sleep, and although it was developed for use in the intensive care setting, the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire held greatest potential due to its ease and rapidity of use. However, it has yet to be validated for use with general hospital inpatients, and further research is required in this area.], accnum: %q[24636444], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["Hoey, L.

Record.create(abstract: %q[ACCESSIBLE SUMMARY: Alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) causes a broad range of both neurological and neurocognitive impairment. Mental health nurses are required to provide programmes designed to facilitate individuals with chronic alcohol dependency to radically change their drinking behaviour, invariably with an abstinence focus. No evidence that related to the nutritional and physical intervention needs of this group was found. Most instruments used to access domains relevant to ARBD in terms of providing a comprehensive assessment have not been validated in this group. Alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) is primarily caused by chronic alcohol misuse and thiamine deficiency, and results in a broad range of impairments. Despite the increasing incidence of ARBD in the UK in recent decades, it is currently underdiagnosed, managed inappropriately and treated inadequately. Moreover, information about assessments for individuals with ARBD is currently absent from clinical guidelines and policy documents. The aim of this paper was to review the evidence relating to the neurological, neuropsychological, psychosocial, physical and nutritional assessment of individuals with ARBD to identify appropriate assessment tools that could be used to measure and monitor the impact of ARBD over time. A systematic online database search revealed a total of 160 separate references, 133 of which were rejected and two of which could not be accessed. Twenty-five papers were included in the review, including six neuroimaging studies, 17 neuropsychological studies and two studies using psychosocial methods of assessment. A lack of evidence for nutritional and physical assessment of individuals with ARBD was found. The review findings are inconclusive; most instruments currently used in ARBD research have not specifically been validated for use within an ARBD context. Further research is required to identify comprehensive methods of ARBD assessment.], accnum: %q[24846298], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Horton, L.", "Duffy, T.", "Hollins Martin, C.", "Martin, C.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: To review the use of quality of life (QOL) measures utilised in children and youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS: Relevant articles were identified through database searches using MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus with Full Text and SPORTDiscus with Full Text via EBSCO Health Database, PsycINFO and ProQuest Health and Medicine (from 2000 to May 2013). Original research articles were included that measured QOL in children and youth with ASD aged 5-20 years. Searches were limited to articles from peer-reviewed journals, in English or German, and those available in full text. RESULTS: The search identified 1,165 titles and 13 met the inclusion criteria. The review identified a number of QOL measures used in children and youth with ASD, with the most common one being the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). QOL measures using self-reports were uncommon, and the reliability and validity of QOL measures were not sufficiently reported for this population. Large discrepancies in QOL scores were found between self-reports and proxy-reports. Despite the differences in study design and methodological quality, there was consistency in the results among studies; children and youth with ASD provided lower QOL scores, particularly for social domains, compared to their healthy counterparts.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Body contouring following massive weight loss is a rapidly expanding field in plastic surgery. However, healthcare payers are reluctant to fund such procedures, viewing them as purely cosmetic. This has resulted in a flurry of studies assessing quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction following body contouring surgery in this cohort of patients to establish an evidence base to support the idea that body contouring is as much (or even more) a functional procedure as it is cosmetic. However, the methods employed in these studies are seldom ideal, and hence the conclusions are unreliable. The gold standard to assess QoL and patient satisfaction is to use patient specific psychometrically validated patient reported outcome (PRO) measures. Developing such measures consists of a three-step process which includes a review of the current literature, qualitative patient interviews to determine what patients consider the most important, and expert opinion. This study aims to appraise the currently available literature on assessment of QoL and patient satisfaction in body contouring surgery patients.

METHODS: An extensive literature review was carried out to identify all existing ophthalmic PRO instruments. Instruments were then excluded if they did not have demonstrable interval measurement properties; the remaining instruments were reviewed. The quality of the following psychometric properties was assessed: content development (initial item development process), performance of the response scale, dimensionality (whether the instrument measures a single construct), measurement precision, validity (convergent, concurrent, discriminant, and known groups), reliability (test-retest), targeting (whether the items are appropriate [e.g., difficulty level] for the population), differential item functioning (whether subgroups of people respond differently to an item), and responsiveness. RESULTS: The search identified 48 PRO instruments that demonstrated interval measurement properties, and these were relevant to nine applications: glaucoma, dry eye, refractive errors, cataract, amblyopia and strabismus, macular diseases, adult low vision, children low vision, and others.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: To systematically appraise the evidence on measurement properties of performance-based outcome measures to assess physical function in young and middle-aged people known to be at high risk of hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus and SPORTDiscus in May 2013. Two reviewers independently rated the measurement properties using the 4-point COSMIN checklist. Best evidence synthesis was made using COSMIN quality, consistency and direction of findings and sample size. RESULTS: Twenty of 2736 papers were eligible for inclusion and 24 different performance-based outcome measures knee or obese populations were evaluated. No tests related to hip populations were included. Twenty-five measurement properties including reliability (nine studies), construct validity (hypothesis testing) (nine studies), measurement error (three studies), structural validity (two studies), interpretability (one study) and responsiveness (one study) were evaluated. A positive rating was given to 12.5% (30/240) of all possible measurement ratings. Tests were grouped into two categories based on the population characteristics. The one-legged hop for distance, followed by the 6-m timed hop and cross over hop for distance were the best-rated tests for the knee-injured population. Whereas the 6-min walk test was the only included test for the obese population. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the many gaps in knowledge about the measurement properties of performance-based outcome measures for young and middle-aged people known to be at high risk of hip and/or knee OA. There is a need for consensus on which outcome measures should be used and/or combined when assessing physical function in this population.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The aims were to compile a schematic overview of clinical scapular assessment methods and critically appraise the methodological quality of the involved studies. A systematic, computer-assisted literature search using Medline, CINAHL, SportDiscus and EMBASE was performed from inception to October 2013. Reference lists in articles were also screened for publications. From 50 articles, 54 method names were identified and categorized into three groups: (1) Static positioning assessment (n = 19); (2) Semi-dynamic (n = 13); and (3) Dynamic functional assessment (n = 22). Fifteen studies were excluded for evaluation due to no/few clinimetric results, leaving 35 studies for evaluation. Graded according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN checklist), the methodological quality in the reliability and validity domains was "fair" (57%) to "poor" (43%), with only one study rated as "good". The reliability domain was most often investigated. Few of the assessment methods in the included studies that had "fair" or "good" measurement property ratings demonstrated acceptable results for both reliability and validity. We found a substantially larger number of clinical scapular assessment methods than previously reported. Using the COSMIN checklist the methodological quality of the included measurement properties in the reliability and validity domains were in general "fair" to "poor". None were examined for all three domains: (1) reliability; (2) validity; and (3) responsiveness.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: This study conducted a systematic review of the methodological quality of the psychometric evaluation process and the quality of measurement properties of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-specific health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) questionnaires with the purpose of obtaining the best evidence to help in the selection of the most appropriate instrument for measuring HRQOL in RA patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify RA-specific HRQOL questionnaires in databases. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments checklist. The quality of the measurement properties was assessed using quality criteria. The evidence regarding the measurement properties was pooled using best-evidence synthesis, with considerations of the number and methodological quality of the studies, and the consistency of their findings in terms of the quality of the measurement properties. RESULTS: The search identified 37 studies describing 9 instruments. Best-evidence synthesis suggested that the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) questionnaire had the strongest positive evidence, especially with respect to reliability, measurement error, and content validity, and moderate positive evidence with respect to hypothesis testing and responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence suggests that the best-validated instrument among the RA-specific HRQOL measures is the RAQoL questionnaire in terms of both methodological quality in the process of psychometric evaluation and the quality of the measurement properties. However, there is limited evidence regarding internal consistency and structural validity of the RAQoL.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Quality of life has emerged as an essential health component that broadens the traditionally narrow concerns focused on only morbidity and life expectancy. Although a growing number of tools to measure quality of life are in circulation, there is a lack of guidelines as well as rigorous assessment for their use with pregnant and postpartum populations. It is also unclear whether these instruments could validly be employed to measure patient-reported outcomes in comparative effectiveness research of maternal care interventions. This paper reviews articles cited in CINAHL, COCHRANE, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, and PUBMED that addressed quality of life in pregnant and postpartum populations. Instruments used to measure quality of life in selected articles were assessed for their adherence to international guidelines for health outcomes instrument development and validation. The authors identified 129 articles that addressed quality of life in pregnant and/or postpartum women. Out of these, only 64 quality (generic and specific) scales were judged relevant to be included in this study. Analysis of measurement scales used in the pregnant and/or postpartum populations revealed important validity, reliability and psychometric inadequacies that negate their use in comparative effectiveness analysis in pregnant and post-partum populations. Valid, reliable, and responsive instruments to measure patient-reported outcomes in pregnant and postpartum populations are lacking.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder. Currently, the main goals of treatment are to induce and maintain clinical and/or endoscopic remission. However, evidence indicates that persistent disease activity on colonic biopsies in the setting of clinical or endoscopic remission is an independent predictor of poor outcomes. A number of previous studies have proposed histologic indices for use in specific trials of UC. The aim of this study was to systematically review the existing histological indices for UC and assess their potential use in both patient management and clinical trials. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of histological indices evaluating disease activity in UC. MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PubMed, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), and Digestive Diseases Week (DDW) abstracts of randomized and/or controlled trials clinical trials were searched from inception to February 2013 for applicable studies. Data from these studies were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: After systematically applying inclusion criteria, we identified 108 scientific articles including 88 clinical studies and 21 related clinical reviews. Eighteen indices of histological activity in UC were identified and reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Although multiple histological scoring indices for assessment of UC disease activity currently exist, none of these instruments were developed using a formal validation process and their operating properties remain poorly understood.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Accurate measurement of functional improvement in clinical practice is becoming increasingly recognized as essential in demonstrating whether patients are deriving meaningful benefit from care. Several simple questionnaires have been developed for this purpose. The majority of these have been developed in English. In North America, there is a growing need for clinical tools, including outcome assessment tools that are available in the Spanish language. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding spine-specific outcome assessment questionnaires that are available in Spanish and to examine the evidence on their clinical utility. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: The Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and MANTIS databases were searched for any studies on the topic of outcome assessment questionnaires in the Spanish language. Relevant articles were reviewed, and the data on reliability, validity, time to completion, and any other properties of the questionnaire was extracted. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 287 articles, of which 10 were deemed relevant. With regard to neck pain, data were found regarding Spanish translations of the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Core Outcome Measure for neck pain. With regard to low back pain, data were found regarding Spanish translations of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index (ODI), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ), and the North American Spine Society-American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Several reliable and valid outcome assessment questionnaires are available in the Spanish language. All were originally developed in English. It appears from the data reviewed that the most useful instruments are the NDI for neck pain patients and the ODI and RMQ for low back pain patients.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: Considering that the number of people with oncological history is constantly growing, and that cancer survivorship has very specific long-term and late (both medical and psychosocial) effects, it seems useful to have specific multidimensional instruments to measure quality of life (QoL). This contribution aims to describe the characteristics and psychometric properties of QoL assessment tools specifically designed for the condition of long-term cancer survivorship. METHODS: We queried the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases, which allowed us to identify the pertinent papers, classified by the QoL tool they refer to. We then extracted the characteristics and the psychometric properties from each study. RESULTS: From the initial 902 papers, 18 meet the selection criteria referring to eight QoL measurements. However, a multipart validation process in order to verify validity and reliability was only started for two of these tools. CONCLUSIONS: Even though clinical practice documents that long-term cancer survivors present with different symptoms and functional challenges compared to patients who are currently undergoing treatment as well as the general population, we still lack a quality of life tool that is specific for them, and that has verified psychometric properties.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Health impairments can result in disability and changed work productivity imposing considerable costs for the employee, employer and society as a whole. A large number of instruments exist to measure health-related productivity changes; however their methodological quality remains unclear. This systematic review critically appraised the measurement properties in generic self-reported instruments that measure health-related productivity changes to recommend appropriate instruments for use in occupational and economic health practice. METHODS: PubMed, PsycINFO, Econlit and Embase were systematically searched for studies whereof: (i) instruments measured health-related productivity changes; (ii) the aim was to evaluate instrument measurement properties; (iii) instruments were generic; (iv) ratings were self-reported; (v) full-texts were available. Next, methodological quality appraisal was based on COSMIN elements: (i) internal consistency; (ii) reliability; (iii) measurement error; (iv) content validity; (v) structural validity; (vi) hypotheses testing; (vii) cross-cultural validity; (viii) criterion validity; and (ix) responsiveness. Recommendations are based on evidence syntheses. RESULTS: This review included 25 articles assessing the reliability, validity and responsiveness of 15 different generic self-reported instruments measuring health-related productivity changes. Most studies evaluated criterion validity, none evaluated cross-cultural validity and information on measurement error is lacking. The Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ) was most frequently evaluated with moderate respectively strong positive evidence for content and structural validity and negative evidence for reliability, hypothesis testing and responsiveness. Less frequently evaluated, the Stanford Presenteeism Scale (SPS) showed strong positive evidence for internal consistency and structural validity, and moderate positive evidence for hypotheses testing and criterion validity. The Productivity and Disease Questionnaire (PRODISQ) yielded strong positive evidence for content validity, evidence for other properties is lacking. The other instruments resulted in mostly fair-to-poor quality ratings with limited evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Decisions based on the content of the instrument, usage purpose, target country and population, and available evidence are recommended. Until high-quality studies are in place to accurately assess the measurement properties of the currently available instruments, the WLQ and, in a Dutch context, the PRODISQ are cautiously preferred based on its strong positive evidence for content validity.

RESULTS: A total of 101 instruments emerged. The majority (89; 88.1%) were developed in other countries; the remaining (14; 13.9%) were developed and validated in the Italian context. The instruments were developed to measure patient's problems (63/101; 62.4%), outcomes (27/101; 26.7%), risks (4/101; 4%) and others issues (7/101; 6.9%). The majority of participants involved in the validation processes were younger adults (49; 48.5%), older adults (40; 39.5%), children (4; 4%), adolescents (3; 3%), and children/adolescents (1; 1%).

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: This review sought to identify and summarize the instruments adapted or developed for measuring HRQoL among young children (<8 years) living in resource-limited settings. METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted in two phases. Phase one searched the PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Knowledge (Web of Science), African Index Medicus, and SocINDEX databases and identified widely used child HRQoL instruments. Phase two reviewed the articles using the selected HRQoL instruments and extracted information on their use in resource-limited settings including adaption processes. RESULTS: Seven instruments were identified that measured the HRQoL of young children. Six had been used in resource-limited settings. Of the 452 articles using these instruments, a total of 23 (5 %) studies used one of the identified HRQoL instruments in a resource-limited setting. Among these studies, 39 % employed an adaptation process for the use of that instrument. No instruments had been developed specifically for measuring the HRQoL of young children in resource-limited settings. CONCLUSIONS: If pediatric HRQoL instruments are to be used in resource-limited settings, it is critical that they be developed and adequately adapted to those settings.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: Mindfulness has emerged as an important health concept based on evidence that mindfulness interventions reduce symptoms and improve health-related quality of life. The objectives of this study were to systematically assess and compare the properties of instruments to measure self-reported mindfulness. METHODS: Ovid Medline((R)), CINAHL((R)), and PsycINFO((R)) were searched through May 2012, and articles were selected if their primary purpose was development or evaluation of the measurement properties (validity, reliability, responsiveness) of a self-report mindfulness scale. Two reviewers independently evaluated the methodological quality of the selected studies using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments checklist. Discrepancies were discussed with a third reviewer and scored by consensus. Finally, a level of evidence approach was used to synthesize the results and study quality. RESULTS: Our search strategy identified a total of 2,588 articles. Forty-six articles, reporting 79 unique studies, met inclusion criteria. Ten instruments quantifying mindfulness as a unidimensional scale (n = 5) or as a set of 2-5 subscales (n = 5) were reviewed. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale was evaluated by the most studies (n = 27) and had positive overall quality ratings for most of the psychometric properties reviewed. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire received the highest possible rating ("consistent findings in multiple studies of good methodological quality") for two properties, internal consistency and construct validation by hypothesis testing. However, none of the instruments had sufficient evidence of content validity. Comprehensiveness of construct coverage had not been assessed; qualitative methods to confirm understanding and relevance were absent. In addition, estimates of test-retest reliability, responsiveness, or measurement error to guide users in protocol development or interpretation of scores were lacking. CONCLUSIONS: Current mindfulness scales have important conceptual differences, and none can be strongly recommended based solely on superior psychometric properties. Important limitations in the field are the absence of qualitative evaluations and accepted external referents to support construct validity.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Musician's dystonia (MD) is a focal adult-onset dystonia most commonly involving the hand. It has much greater relative prevalence than non-musician's focal hand dystonias, exhibits task specificity at the level of specific musical passages, and is a particularly difficult form of dystonia to treat. For most MD patients, the diagnosis confirms the end of their music performance careers. Research on treatments and pathophysiology is contingent upon measures of motor function abnormalities. In this review, we comprehensively survey the literature to identify the rating scales used in MD and the distribution of their use. We also summarize the extent to which the scales have been evaluated for their clinical utility, including reliability, validity, sensitivity, specificity to MD, and practicality for a clinical setting. Out of 135 publications, almost half (62) included no quantitative measures of motor function. The remaining 73 studies used a variety of choices from among 10 major rating scales. Most used subjective scales involving either patient or clinician ratings. Only 25% (18) of the studies used objective scales. None of the scales has been completely and rigorously evaluated for clinical utility. Whether studies involved treatments or pathophysiologic assays, there was a heterogeneous choice of rating scales used with no clear standard. As a result, the collective interpretive value of those studies is limited because the results are confounded by measurement effects. We suggest that the development and widespread adoption of a new clinically useful rating scale is critical for accelerating basic and clinical research in MD.], accnum: %q[23884039], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Peterson, D.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND/AIM: This article aims to (1) identify instruments available to measure activity and participation in children with disabilities; (2) describe the reliability and validity of these instruments; and (3) consider whether the available instruments capture the extent of involvement, as well as the difficulty and satisfaction/enjoyment associated with performance in all life areas. METHOD: A literature review was completed by undertaking an electronic search to identify instruments that measure activity and participation in children with disabilities. A further electronic search was conducted to obtain an adequate description of the instruments, including psychometric properties. RESULTS: The search identified 20 instruments purporting to measure activity and participation, however, no single instrument measured extent of involvement, difficulty and satisfaction/enjoyment in all life areas. There were instances in which each of these aspects was captured, but not within the one instrument. Instruments assessed combinations of frequency, difficulty, assistance, environment and satisfaction across varying contexts, for example, school, domestic life, recreational tasks, leisure tasks or all life areas. CONCLUSIONS: Although a large number of instruments exist to measure varying aspects of activity and participation, there is currently no single instrument available to measure the extent of involvement, difficulty and satisfaction/enjoyment in all life areas.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: It is critical for gastrointestinal cancer researchers and clinicians to have access to comprehensive, sensitive and simple-to-use symptom measures that allow them to understand and quantify the subjective patient experience. Development and validation of such scales requires training in psychometrics and occasionally uses technical jargon that can be difficult to penetrate. This review evaluates existing measures of gastrointestinal cancer symptoms, provides tool descriptions, and uses predefined, objective quality criteria to rate psychometric quality and facilitate tool choices for researchers and clinicians. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were systematically reviewed for scales assessing gastrointestinal cancer and gastrointestinal cancer site-specific symptoms. Evaluation criteria were the following: breadth of domain coverage (content validity), high internal consistency (alpha >/= .80), sensitivity to change, and extent of validation. RESULTS: In n = 36 validation studies, 26 gastrointestinal cancer symptom measures were identified. Of these, n = 13 tools met criteria for recommendation, and six in particular showed strong psychometric properties. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) gastric cancer module (QLQ-STO22), FACT-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep), and EORTC oesophagus, oesophago-gastric junction and stomach module (QLQ OG-25) were identified as the most comprehensive and best validated scales for each of the major gastrointestinal cancer sites. The FACT-Colorectal Symptom Index (FCSI-9) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) FACT-Hepatobiliary Symptom Index (FHSI-18) were specifically validated in patients with advanced colorectal and liver cancer and also demonstrated superior psychometric properties. CONCLUSIONS: Several comprehensive, well-validated scales exist to adequately assess gastrointestinal cancer site-specific symptoms. Specifically, gastrointestinal cancer submodules of the FACT quality of life questionnaire represent adequate tool choices in most instances and overall, were better validated than the respective EORTC tools.

Record.create(abstract: %q[RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Phlebitis is a common and painful complication of peripheral intravenous cannulation. The aim of this review was to identify the measures used in infusion phlebitis assessment and evaluate evidence regarding their reliability, validity, responsiveness and feasibility. METHOD: We conducted a systematic literature review of the Cochrane library, Ovid MEDLINE and EBSCO CINAHL until September 2013. All English-language studies (randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort and cross-sectional) that used an infusion phlebitis scale were retrieved and analysed to determine which symptoms were included in each scale and how these were measured. We evaluated studies that reported testing the psychometric properties of phlebitis assessment scales using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidelines. RESULTS: Infusion phlebitis was the primary outcome measure in 233 studies. Fifty-three (23%) of these provided no actual definition of phlebitis. Of the 180 studies that reported measuring phlebitis incidence and/or severity, 101 (56%) used a scale and 79 (44%) used a definition alone. We identified 71 different phlebitis assessment scales. Three scales had undergone some psychometric analyses, but no scale had been rigorously tested. CONCLUSION: Many phlebitis scales exist, but none has been thoroughly validated for use in clinical practice.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To explore the scope, reliability, and validity of community integration measures for older adults after traumatic brain injury (TBI). DATA SOURCES: A search of peer-reviewed articles in English from 1990 to April 2011 was conducted using the EBSCO Health and Scopus databases. Search terms included were community integration, traumatic brain injury or TBI, 65 plus or older adults, and assessment. STUDY SELECTION: Forty-three eligible articles were identified, with 11 selected for full review using a standardized critical review method. DATA EXTRACTION: Common community integration measures were identified and ranked for relevance and psychometric properties. Of the 43 eligible articles, studies reporting community integration outcomes post-TBI were identified and critically reviewed. Older adults' community integration needs post-TBI from high quality studies were summarized. DATA SYNTHESIS: There is a relative lack of evidence pertaining to older adults post-TBI, but indicators are that older adults have poorer outcomes than their younger counterparts. The Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) is the most widely used community integration measurement tool used in research for people with TBI. Because of some limitations, many studies have used the CIQ in conjunction with other measures to better quantify and/or monitor changes in community integration. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing integration of older adults after TBI into their community of choice, with particular emphasis on social integration and quality of life, should be a primary rehabilitation goal. However, more research is needed to inform best practice guidelines to meet the needs of this growing TBI population. It is recommended that subjective tools, such as quality of life measures, are used in conjunction with well-established community integration measures, such as the CIQ, during the assessment process.], accnum: %q[24016401], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Ritchie, L.", "Wright-St Clair, V.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Patients in a critical care unit sleep quite poorly even when they appear to be sleeping. Sleep is light and fragmented. Acute lack of sleep causes patients suffering in the form of fatigue, irritability, disorientation and hallucinations. It may also affect their recovery and immune defence. To promote sleep, nurses must be able to evaluate patients' sleep reliably. AIM AND OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to form a comprehensive overview of the sleep evaluation methods in critical care. Our objectives were to determine the content and the quality of the methods as reported by the researchers. This overview hopefully improves the use of the sleep evaluation methods as part of sleep promoting nursing interventions and practices. METHOD: The literature search was performed from the Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, an 'All EBM Reviews', and PsycINFO databases. The search terms sleep, evaluating sleep and critical care were used. An integrative review method was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: According to the 52 articles of this review, there is a wide variety of methods to evaluate patients' sleep in critical care by observation, by asking for patient's own perception and by objective measures. Most instruments evaluate only total sleep time or the quality of sleep in general. The validity and reliability of the instruments has been insufficiently reported. Some questionnaires for patients' perception have been tested and used in several studies. CONCLUSION: Sleep evaluation instruments do not cover all dimensions of sleep since they mostly measure total sleep time or estimate the overall quality of sleep. The quality of the sleep evaluation instruments varies from scientifically tested tools to untested instruments. This review will allow nurses to recognise the strengths and limitations of sleep evaluation instruments when selecting one to be used in critical care.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: A high level of participant skill is influential in determining the outcome of many sports. Thus, tests assessing skill outcomes in sport are commonly used by coaches and researchers to estimate an athlete's ability level, to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions or for the purpose of talent identification. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to examine the methodological quality, measurement properties and feasibility characteristics of sporting skill outcome tests reported in the peer-reviewed literature. DATA SOURCES: A search of both SPORTDiscus and MEDLINE databases was undertaken. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that examined tests of sporting skill outcomes were reviewed. Only studies that investigated measurement properties of the test (reliability or validity) were included. A total of 22 studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: A customised checklist of assessment criteria, based on previous research, was utilised for the purpose of this review. RESULTS: A range of sports were the subject of the 22 studies included in this review, with considerations relating to methodological quality being generally well addressed by authors. A range of methods and statistical procedures were used by researchers to determine the measurement properties of their skill outcome tests. The majority (95%) of the reviewed studies investigated test-retest reliability, and where relevant, inter and intra-rater reliability was also determined. Content validity was examined in 68% of the studies, with most tests investigating multiple skill domains relevant to the sport. Only 18% of studies assessed all three reviewed forms of validity (content, construct and criterion), with just 14% investigating the predictive validity of the test. Test responsiveness was reported in only 9% of studies, whilst feasibility received varying levels of attention. LIMITATIONS: In organised sport, further tests may exist which have not been investigated in this review. This could be due to such tests firstly not being published in the peer-review literature and secondly, not having their measurement properties (i.e., reliability or validity) examined formally. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 22 studies included in this review, items relating to test methodological quality were, on the whole, well addressed. Test-retest reliability was determined in all but one of the reviewed studies, whilst most studies investigated at least two aspects of validity (i.e., content, construct or criterion-related validity). Few studies examined predictive validity or responsiveness. While feasibility was addressed in over half of the studies, practicality and test limitations were rarely addressed.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. STUDY SELECTION: English-only publications through December 2012 with at least 30 patients older than 18 years, which included the key words of adult, critically ill, subjective sedation scale, sedation scale, validity, and reliability. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers evaluated the psychometric properties using a standardized sedation scale psychometric scoring system. DATA SYNTHESIS: Among the 19,000+ citations extracted for the 2013 Society of Critical Care Medicine's Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Pain, Agitation and Delirium and from December 2010 to 2012, 36 articles were identified compassing 11 sedation scales. The scale development process, psychometric properties, feasibility, and implementation of sedation scales were analyzed using a 0-20 scoring system. Two scales demonstrated scores indicating "very good" published psychometric properties: Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (19.5) and the Sedation-Agitation Scale (19). Scores with "moderate" properties include the Vancouver Interaction and Calmness Scale (14.3), Adaptation to the Intensive Care Environment (13.7), Ramsay Sedation Scale (13.2), Minnesota Sedation Assessment Tool (13), and the Nursing Instrument for the Communication of Sedation (12.8). Scales with "low" properties included the Motor Activity Assessment Scale (11.5) and the Sedation Intensive Care Score (10.5). The New Sheffield Sedation Scale (8.5) and the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (3.7) demonstrated "very low" published properties. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current literature, and using a predetermined psychometric scoring system, the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Sedation-Agitation Scale are the most valid and reliable subjective sedation scales for use in critically ill adult patients.], accnum: %q[23989092], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Robinson, B.

Record.create(abstract: %q[This is one of seven interlinked systematic reviews undertaken on behalf of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology as part of their Guidelines for Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis, which focuses on instruments developed for IgE-mediated food allergy. Disease-specific questionnaires are significantly more sensitive than generic ones in measuring the response to interventions or future treatments, as well as estimating the general burden of food allergy. The aim of this systematic review was therefore to identify which disease-specific, validated instruments can be employed to enable assessment of the impact of, and investigations and interventions for, IgE-mediated food allergy on health-related quality of life (HRQL). Using a sensitive search strategy, we searched seven electronic bibliographic databases to identify disease-specific quality of life (QOL) tools relating to IgE-mediated food allergy. From the 17 eligible studies, we identified seven disease-specific HRQL instruments, which were then subjected to detailed quality appraisal. This revealed that these instruments have undergone formal development and validation processes, and have robust psychometric properties, and therefore provide a robust means of establishing the impact of food allergy on QOL. Suitable instruments are now available for use in children, adolescents, parents/caregivers, and adults.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Assessment of endoscopic disease activity, as measured by various endoscopic evaluative instruments, is an essential part of quantifying disease activity in clinical trials in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Evaluative instruments have specific definitions and operating properties that influence the interpretation of clinical trial results. Our objective was to systematically review all endoscopic evaluative instruments that measure endoscopic disease activity in UC and to describe their definitions and operating characteristics (reliability, responsiveness, and predictive validity). METHODS: We performed a systematic review of evaluative instruments assessing endoscopic disease activity in UC. MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PubMed, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), and Digestive Disease Week abstracts of clinical trials were searched from inception to January 2013. RESULTS: In total, 5885 studies were identified and screened for inclusion criteria. Four hundred twenty-two studies involving 31 evaluative instruments were identified. Two types of indices were found, numerical scoring systems and stepwise grading scales. CONCLUSIONS: Both the endoscopic evaluative instrument selected and the definition chosen for mucosal healing affect the validity of assessing endoscopic disease activity during a clinical trial for UC. Currently, the sigmoidoscopic component of the Mayo Score and the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity show the most promise as reliable evaluative instruments of endoscopic disease activity.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to perform a standardized and systematic evaluation of the available evidence on multi-item shoulder-specific patient-reported outcome measures that are applicable to a wide spectrum of disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in PubMed to identify articles with information regarding the development process, metric properties, and administration issues of shoulder-specific patient-reported outcome measures. Two experts independently reviewed all the articles identified for one instrument and applied the EMPRO (Evaluating Measures of Patient Reported Outcomes) tool, which was designed to assess the quality of attributes in a standardized way. An overall EMPRO score and 6 attribute-specific scores were calculated (range, 0-100) to describe the quality of instrument performance. RESULTS: We identified 11 instruments and 112 articles (2-30 articles per instrument). The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) shoulder assessment, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) were the best rated, with overall scores of 77.4 points, 72.6 points, and 69.7 points, respectively. They have been shown to be valid, reliable, and responsive, with a low administration burden. Acceptable results were also found for the Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, and Dutch Shoulder Disability Questionnaire, but some of their attributes need further evaluation.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: The objective was to obtain a standardized evaluation of available prostate cancer-specific quality of life instruments used in patients with early-stage disease. METHODS: We carried out systematic literature reviews in the PubMed database to identify manuscripts which contained information regarding either the development process or metric properties of prostate cancer-specific quality of life instruments. Each instrument was evaluated by two experts, independently, using the Evaluating Measures of Patient-Reported Outcomes (EMPRO) tool. An overall and seven attribute-specific EMPRO scores were calculated (range 0-100, worst to best): measurement model, reliability, validity, responsiveness, interpretability, burden and alternative forms. RESULTS: Eight instruments and 57 manuscripts (2-15 per instrument) were identified. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) was the best rated (overall EMPRO score 83.1 points). Good results were also obtained by University of California Los Angeles-Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI), Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale (PORPUS) and Prostate Cancer Quality of Life Instrument (PC-QoL) with 77.3, 70.5 and 64.8 points, respectively. These four instruments passed with distinction the validity and responsiveness evaluation. Insufficient reliability results were observed for UCLA-PCI and PORPUS. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports the choice of EPIC, PORPUS or PC-QoL. Attribute-specific EMPRO results facilitate selecting the adequate instrument for every purpose.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Little is known about the comparative validity, reliability, or responsiveness of instruments for assessing cough frequency or impact, where the term impact encompasses both cough severity and the impact of cough on health-related quality of life. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate instruments that assess cough frequency or impact in adults, adolescents, and children with acute or chronic cough. RESULTS: Seventy-eight studies were included, of which eight were randomized controlled trials and 70 were observational studies. In all age groups, audio and video electronic recording devices had good reliability compared with other methods of assessing cough frequency but had variable correlation with other cough assessments, such as visual analog scale scores, quality-of-life questionnaires, cough diaries, and tussigenic challenges. Among adult and adolescent patients, the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and the Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (CQLQ) were valid and reliable, showing high intraclass and test-retest correlations. Among children, the Parent Cough-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire and Pediatric Cough Questionnaire were valid and reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Electronic recording devices can be valid assessments of cough frequency. The LCQ and CQLQ for adults and the Parent Cough-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire for children are valid instruments for assessing cough impact.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Clinical signs are a core outcome domain for atopic dermatitis (AD) trials. The current lack of standardization of outcome measures in AD trials hampers evidence-based communication. OBJECTIVE: We sought to provide evidence-based recommendations for the measurement of clinical signs in AD trials and to inform the Harmonising Outcome Measures for Atopic Dermatitis Initiative. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on measurement properties of outcome measurements for clinical signs of AD. We systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase (until October 1, 2012) for validation studies on instruments measuring the clinical signs of AD. Grading of the truth, discrimination, and feasibility of scales; methodological study quality; and recommendations were based on predefined criteria. RESULTS: Sixteen eligible instruments were identified, of which 2 were best validated. The Eczema Area and Severity Index has adequate validity, responsiveness, internal consistency, intraobserver reliability, and intermediate interobserver reliability but unclear interpretability and feasibility. The Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis Index (SCORAD) has adequate validity, responsiveness, interobserver reliability, and interpretability and unclear intraobserver reliability. Only the objective SCORAD (ie, the clinical signs domain of the SCORAD) is internally consistent. The Six Area, Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis Index severity score and Three Item Severity Score fulfill some quality criteria, but the performance in other required measurement properties is unclear. The Patient-oriented Eczema Measure is reliable and responsive but has inadequate content validity to assess clinical signs of AD. The remaining 11 scales have either (almost) not been validated or performed inadequately.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE Mental health systems internationally have adopted a goal of supporting recovery. Measurement of the experience of recovery is, therefore, a priority. The aim of this review was to identify and analyze recovery measures in relation to their fit with recovery and their psychometric adequacy. METHODS A systematic search of six data sources for articles, Web-based material, and conference presentations related to measurement of recovery was conducted by using a defined search strategy. Results were filtered by title and by abstract (by two raters in the case of abstracts), and the remaining papers were reviewed to identify any suitable measures of recovery. Measures were then evaluated for their fit with the recovery processes identified in the CHIME framework (connectedness, hope, identity, meaning, and empowerment) and for demonstration of nine predefined psychometric properties. RESULTS Thirteen measures of personal recovery were identified from 336 abstracts and 35 articles. The Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS) was published most, and the Questionnaire About the Process of Recovery (QPR) was the only measure to have all items map to the CHIME framework. No measure demonstrated all nine psychometric properties. The Stages of Recovery Instrument demonstrated the most psychometric properties (N=6), followed by the Maryland Assessment of Recovery (N=5), and the QPR and the RAS (N=4).

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Subjects with neurological disease (ND) usually show impaired performance during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit tasks, with a consequent reduction in their mobility levels. OBJECTIVE: To determine the measurement properties and feasibility previously investigated for clinical tests that evaluate sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit in subjects with ND. METHOD: A systematic literature review following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol was performed. Systematic literature searches of databases (MEDLINE/SCIELO/LILACS/PEDro) were performed to identify relevant studies. In all studies, the following inclusion criteria were assessed: investigation of any measurement property or the feasibility of clinical tests that evaluate sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit tasks in subjects with ND published in any language through December 2012. The COSMIN checklist was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included. The measurement properties/feasibility were most commonly investigated for the five-repetition sit-to-stand test, which showed good test-retest reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient:ICC=0.94-0.99) for subjects with stroke, cerebral palsy and dementia. The ICC values were higher for this test than for the number of repetitions in the 30-s test. The five-repetition sit-to-stand test also showed good inter/intra-rater reliabilities (ICC=0.97-0.99) for stroke and inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.99) for subjects with Parkinson disease and incomplete spinal cord injury. For this test, the criterion-related validity for subjects with stroke, cerebral palsy and incomplete spinal cord injury was, in general, moderate (correlation=0.40-0.77), and the feasibility and safety were good for subjects with Alzheimer's disease.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: One of the objectives of this review is to summarize the important features of a good scale. A second aim is to conduct a systematic review to identify scales that can detect the presence of cervical myelopathy and to determine their psychometric properties including validity, reliability and responsiveness. METHODS: A thorough literature search was performed using MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Articles were included in this study if they compared scale measurements between a control and a myelopathic patient population or if they discussed any psychometric property of a scale. RESULTS: An ideal scale should be one that is quantifiable, valid, sensitive, responsive and easy to perform, has high inter/intra-rater reliability, internal consistency and a suitable distribution, and is one-dimensional and relevant. In the context of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, it is essential that the scale also addresses the pathophysiology, its key signs and symptoms as well as its natural history.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Persons in recovery, providers, and policymakers alike are advocating for recovery-oriented mental health care, with the promotion of recovery becoming a prominent feature of mental health policy in the United States and internationally. One step toward creating a recovery-oriented system of care is to use recovery-oriented outcome measures. Numerous instruments have been developed to assess progress towards mental health recovery. This review identifies instruments of mental health recovery and evaluates the appropriateness of their use including their psychometric properties, ease of administration, and service-user involvement in their development. A literature search using the Medline and Psych-INFO databases was conducted, identifying 21 instruments for potential inclusion in this review, of which thirteen met inclusion criteria. Results suggest only three instruments (25%) have had their psychometric properties assessed in three or more unique samples of participants. Ease of administration varied between instruments, and for the majority of instruments, development included service user involvement. This review updates and expands previous reviews of instruments to assess mental health recovery.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed.

An assessment of published (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, AMED, Cochrane library, PEDro) and unpublished/trial registry (OpenGrey, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Current Controlled Trials, the UK National Research Register Archive) databases were undertaken. Methodological quality of the literature was assessed using the QUADAS-2 appraisal tool. Nine studies including 690 participants, with a mean age of 82.1 years were included. The literature demonstrated a high risk of bias for study methodology, but low risk of bias for applicability. Two assessment domains were recognized: pain and delirium. For pain, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and DOLOPLUS-2 tools possessed strong inter-rater reliability and internal consistency, with the FACS demonstrating concurrent validity with other pain scales. For delirium, the Delirium Rating Scale-Revisited-98 (DRS-R-98) demonstrated high inter-rater reliability and sensitivity and specificity, with the NEECHAM Confusion Scale possessing high internal consistency. To conclude, there is a paucity of literature assessing the reliability, validity and diagnostic test accuracy of instruments to assess people with cognitive impairment following hip fracture surgery.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the literature on the psychometric properties of English-language FHS questionnaires in adults with oropharyngeal dysphagia. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using the electronic databases Pubmed and Embase. The psychometric properties of the questionnaires were determined based on the COSMIN taxonomy of measurement properties and definitions for health-related patient-reported outcomes and the COSMIN checklist using preset psychometric criteria. RESULTS: Three questionnaires were included: the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10), the Swallowing Outcome after Laryngectomy (SOAL), and the Self-report Symptom Inventory. The Sydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ) proved to be identical to the Modified Self-report Symptom Inventory. All FHS questionnaires obtained poor overall methodological quality scores for most measurement properties. CONCLUSIONS: The retrieved FHS questionnaires need psychometric reevaluation; if the overall methodological quality shows satisfactory improvement on most measurement properties, the use of the questionnaires in daily clinic and research can be justified.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Visual sampling techniques are used to investigate the complex role of vision during real-world activities in Parkinson's disease. Earlier research is limited to static simple tasks or measurement of eye movements alone, but more recent investigations involve more real-world activities. The approach to the objective measurement of eye movements varies with respect to instrumentation, testing protocols, and mediating factors that may influence visual sampling. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to examine previous work measuring visual sampling during real-world activities in Parkinson's disease to inform the development of robust protocols. Within this review a real-world activity was considered to be a goal-orientated motor task involving more than one body segment such as reaching or walking. METHODS: Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, PubMed and the Cochrane library databases were searched. Two independent reviewers and an adjudicator screened articles that described quantitative visual sampling in people with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. RESULTS: Twenty full-text articles were screened and 15 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. A wide range of instruments and outcome measures were reported which were generally used in a task-dependent manner. Instrument reliability and validity was insufficiently reported in all studies. Few studies considered mediators of visual sampling such as visual or cognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Future research is required to accurately characterise visual impairments in Parkinson's disease and during real-world activities. Composite use of instruments may be required to achieve reliability and validity of visual sampling outcomes which need to be standardised. Recommendations also include assessment of cognition and basic visual function.], accnum: %q[24291711], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)", "Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Stuart, S.", "Alcock, L.", "Galna, B.", "Lord, S.", "Rochester, L."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: ["Diseases of and symptoms related to the nervous system"], doi: %q[10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.11.018], endnum: %q[204], fs: ["Physical functioning"], ghp: [], id: 556, instrument: [], issn: %q[1872-678X (Electronic)], journal: %q[J Neurosci Methods], oql: [], pnp: ["Non-patient Reported Outcome"], pubyear: %q[2014], ss: [], startpage: %q[175-88], status: %q[published], title: %q[The measurement of visual sampling during real-world activity in Parkinson's disease and healthy controls: a structured literature review], tmi: ["4 - Performance-based tests", "8 - Imaging tests", "9 - Laboratory tests", "7 - Observations"], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24291711"])

Sound psychometric properties of HRQoL questionnaires are a precondition for assessing the impact of dysphagia, the focus of this study, resulting in recommendations for the appropriate use of these questionnaires in both clinical practice and research contexts. We performed a systematic review starting with a search for and retrieval of all full-text articles on the development of HRQoL questionnaires related to oropharyngeal dysphagia and/or their psychometric validation from the electronic databases PubMed and Embase published up to June 2011. Psychometric properties were judged according to quality criteria proposed for health status questionnaires. Eight questionnaires were included in this study. Four are aimed solely at HRQoL in oropharyngeal dysphagia: the deglutition handicap index (DHI), dysphagia handicap index (DHI'), M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI), and SWAL-QOL, while the EDGQ, EORTC QLQ-STO 22, EORTC QLQ-OG 25 and EORTC QLQ-H&N35 focus on other primary diseases resulting in dysphagia. The psychometric properties of the DHI, DHI', MDADI, and SWAL-QOL were evaluated. For appropriate applicability of HRQoL questionnaires, strong scores on the psychometric criteria face validity, criterion validity, and interpretability are prerequisites. The SWAL-QOL has the strongest ratings for these criteria, while the DHI' is the most easy to apply given its 25 items and the use of a uniform scoring format.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: A major barrier to improving perinatal mental health in Africa is the lack of locally validated tools for identifying probable cases of perinatal depression or for measuring changes in depression symptom severity. We systematically reviewed the evidence on the reliability and validity of instruments to assess perinatal depression in African settings. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Of 1,027 records identified through searching 7 electronic databases, we reviewed 126 full-text reports. We included 25 unique studies, which were disseminated in 26 journal articles and 1 doctoral dissertation. These enrolled 12,544 women living in nine different North and sub-Saharan African countries. Only three studies (12%) used instruments developed specifically for use in a given cultural setting. Most studies provided evidence of criterion-related validity (20 [80%]) or reliability (15 [60%]), while fewer studies provided evidence of construct validity, content validity, or internal structure. The Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS), assessed in 16 studies (64%), was the most frequently used instrument in our sample. Ten studies estimated the internal consistency of the EPDS (median estimated coefficient alpha, 0.84; interquartile range, 0.71-0.87). For the 14 studies that estimated sensitivity and specificity for the EPDS, we constructed 2 x 2 tables for each cut-off score. Using a bivariate random-effects model, we estimated a pooled sensitivity of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.99) and a pooled specificity of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.59-0.88) at a cut-off score of >/= 9, with higher cut-off scores yielding greater specificity at the cost of lower sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The EPDS can reliably and validly measure perinatal depression symptom severity or screen for probable postnatal depression in African countries, but more validation studies on other instruments are needed. In addition, more qualitative research is needed to adequately characterize local understandings of perinatal depression-like syndromes in different African contexts.], accnum: %q[24340036], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Adults (18-65)", "Seniors (65+)"], author: ["Tsai, A.

Second, instruments were included for review when two independent reviewers agreed that the instruments (1) are standardized and objective; (2) assess at activity level and comprise items that reflect ADL; and (3) are applicable to school-aged children that can move independently. Out of 1507 publications, 66 publications were selected, describing 39 instruments.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of instruments that claim to detect submaximal capacity when maximal capacity is requested in patients with chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several instruments have been developed to measure capacity in patients with chronic pain. The detection of submaximal capacity can have major implications for patients. The validity of these instruments has never been systematically reviewed. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed including the following databases: Web of Knowledge (including PubMed and Cinahl), Scopus, and Cochrane. Two reviewers independently selected the articles based on the title and abstract according to the study selection criteria. Studies were included when they contained original data and when they objectified submaximal physical or functional capacity when maximal physical or functional capacity was requested. Two authors independently extracted data and rated the quality of the articles. The included studies were scored according to the subscales "Criterion Validity" and "Hypothesis Testing" of the COSMIN checklist. A Best Evidence Synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Seven studies were included, 5 of which used a reference standard for submaximal capacity. Three studies were of good methodological quality and validly detected submaximal capacity with specificity rates between 75% and 100%.

A Medline literature research resulted in 16 different clinical asthma scores, which have been developed to assess the severity of acute asthma, to predict the outcome of an attack, or to evaluate the response to treatment. Most asthma scores could be easily obtained in children. Three scores have been modified to facilitate application in a younger age-category. Inter-observer agreement has received little attention, although all scores contained items that require subjective judgement. The predictive validity was insufficient to justify the application of clinical scores as a decision rule for the admission or discharge of children with acute asthma. Asthma scores seem to be useful for assessing the severity of an attack and evaluating the response to therapy, but as yet there is insufficient information on the performance of the scores to justify a preference. Wheezing and retractions appear to be important items of any useful score for acute asthma.], accnum: %q[7722576], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: ["Children (0-18)"], author: ["van der Windt, D.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Recent qualitative research has shown that stiffness is an important symptom for patients to identify remission. However, it is unclear how to measure stiffness in low disease activity. This systematic review aims to summarise the existing literature on validity of patient reported outcomes to measure stiffness in RA low disease activity states, to aid the choice for a measurement instrument. METHODS: An extensive pubmed-search was undertaken, identifying measurement instruments for patient perceived stiffness used in low disease activity. Eligible studies reported on 1) stiffness as an outcome in relation to other core set measures, 2) development of a patient reported tool to measure stiffness, or 3) comparison of two different tools to measure aspects of stiffness, all in low disease activity. RESULTS: Of 788 titles, only two studies report on validity of stiffness measures within low disease activity. Morning stiffness (MS) is reported in 44 to 80% of patients in low disease activity. A difference of 40 to 60 minutes in duration until maximum improvement is observed between active and inactive patients. Severity of MS might discriminate better between high and low disease activity compared to measurement of duration of MS.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Imaging may be useful for monitoring response to therapy. Within the OMERACT proposal for the core set domains for outcome measures in chronic gout, serum urate levels, recurrence of gouty flares, tophus regression, and joint damage imaging have been included, among other proposed issues. OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic literature review of the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) on assessment of treatment response in patients with gout. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library (up to February 2012), and abstracts presented at the 2010 and 2011 meetings of the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism, were searched for treatment studies of any duration and therapeutic options, examining the ability of MRI/US to assess treatment response in gouty patients. Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials, cohort and case-control studies and validation studies were included. Quality was appraised using validated scales. RESULTS: There were only 3 US published studies in the literature that analysed US utility on assessment of response to treatment in patients with gout. All of them were prospective case studies with a small number of patients and they were reviewed in detailed. A total of 36 patients with gout were examined with US. All of them had a baseline serum urate >6mg/dL. US features of gout (double contour sign, hyperechoic spots in synovial fluid, hyperechoic cloudy areas, tophus diameter and volume) achieved significant reduction in patients who reached the objective of uricemia </=6mg/dL in all the studies; however, patients in whom levels did not drop below 6mg/dL had no change of US features of gout. Other parameters evaluated in one study included ESR, CRP, number of tender joints (TRN), number of swollen joints, and pain score (SP). All of them decreased with uricemia reduction, but only TRN and SP were statistically significant. No data was found on the value of MRI on treatment response assessment in patients with gout. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in ultrasound features shows concurrent validity with uric acid reduction. According to the published evidence, US can be a useful tool for monitoring treatment of gouty patients, although more research is needed.

DATA SOURCES: Medline, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched between 1946 and April 2014. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently searched data sources. Cerebellar-specific and generic measures of balance were considered. Included studies tested psychometric properties of balance measures in people with cerebellar ataxia of any cause. Quality of reported studies was rated using the Consensus Based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. RESULTS: Twenty-one articles across which 16 measures had been tested were included for review. Using the COSMIN, quality of methodology in studies investigating psychometric properties of generic balance measures (n=10) was rated predominantly as 'poor'. Furthermore, responsiveness has not been tested for any generic measures in this population. The quality of studies investigating psychometric properties of balance sub-components of the cerebellar-specific measures (n=6) ranged from 'poor' to 'excellent'; however, Minimally Clinically Important Difference has not been determined for these cerebellar-specific measures.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC), one of the most common cancers in the world, is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and associated with a poor prognosis. Quality of life and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important considerations when treating GC patients. The aim of this study was to identify existing PRO instruments that would be appropriate for use in GC trials. METHODS: Data were obtained from a systematic literature review and interviews with clinical experts. A literature search was conducted using OVID (EMBASE and MEDLINE) and yielded 1,008 abstracts; 92 assessed PROs in an advanced GC. RESULTS: Key symptoms and functional impacts identified through the literature and expert input included abdominal pain or pain at the site of distant metastases, dysphagia and other symptoms related to eating, and digestive symptoms. The liver and lungs were the most frequent locations of metastases, leading to dyspnea, abdominal fullness, and jaundice. Symptoms related to changes in bowel habits appeared to be more frequent and pronounced in Asian patients, possibly due to the higher prevalence of GC in the body of the stomach in this population. The five most commonly used PRO instruments were identified, but their validity in advanced-stage GC patients remains unclear. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms and functional impacts identified here should be confirmed with robust input from advanced-stage GC patients.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to inform researchers and policymakers about what validated outcome measures are available to evaluate clinical genetics services (CGS) and the need for new measures. METHODS: Validated outcome measures used to evaluate CGS were identified from a systematic literature review. Subjective outcome measures were assumed to have been validated only if some form of psychometric assessment was reported. RESULTS: A total of 1688 titles and abstracts were identified, and 61 articles met the inclusion criteria for the final review, which covered 67 validated outcome measures. There were 37 nongenetics-specific and 30 genetics-specific measures identified. No single validated outcome measure encompassed all potential patient benefits from using a CGS. A variety of different domains were identified, including anxiety and depression, coping, decision-making, distress, family environment, health status, knowledge, mood, perception of risk, perceived personal control, psychological impact, quality of life, satisfaction and expectations, self-esteem, spiritual well-being, and worry. Some important aspects of patient benefit from CGS are not covered by existing outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: New research is necessary to develop the array of outcome measures required to quantify the benefits CGS offer patients living with the effects of genetic conditions.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To assess the content and quality of published wrist outcome instruments using standardized criteria. DESIGN: An analytical study that examined 32 wrist outcome instruments sourced from textbooks, Medline (1951 to present) and Current Contents. MAIN MEASURES: The content of each instrument was classified into four categories: traditional measures (such as range of movement and strength), measures of the ability to perform daily activities, compensatory mechanisms used, and 'other'. Analysis included the frequency of assessment per category and the method of assessment. In addition, each instrument was graded using 13 quality criteria. Three criteria (scientific justification of the content and scoring system used, demographic utility) were considered to be essential. RESULTS: Eighty-two per cent of instruments reviewed for this paper contained traditional measures, of which most were assessed objectively. The ability to perform specific daily activities was assessed in 31% of the instruments whereas compensatory mechanisms were evaluated in only one instrument. These variables were not assessed in a consistent manner. Using the quality scoring system derived for this study, the quality of the instruments was generally poor. Only one instrument fulfilled all of the essential criteria. Only four instruments completely satisfied more than 50% of the criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Most wrist outcome instruments neglected to assess the impact of the disorder on the individual. Outcome was generally not expressed in functional terms or in terms that were relevant to each individual. The majority of the reviewed articles had poor quality.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Introduction: Minimizing the devastating personal and societal impacts of sleep disorders requires early detection and treatment thus falls under the umbrella of primary care. When primary care providers assess for sleep disorders, they typically under-detect. Using a reliable and valid sleep disorder screening questionnaire could remedy this situation. However, availability of questionnaires that can screen for multiple disorders without sacrificing productivity in busy adult primary care practices is unknown. Methods: A systematic review of the literature for ten-minute-or-shorter self-report questionnaires that screen for six sleep disorders was performed. Included questionnaires were assessed for correspondence with diagnostic criteria, validity of scoring strategies, and gen-eralizability to the adult primary care population. Results: None of the seven identified questionnaires have both ten-minute completion time and coverage of six sleep disorders. One brief questionnaire covered five disorders, and another covered six disorders but would require more than twenty minutes to complete. Criteria for an ideal questionnaire targeting primary care comprise n = 15 items that encompass thoroughness, efficiency, content validity, criterion validity, and generalizability to adult primary care population are presented. Though two of the questionnaires meet half of the ideal criteria, neither can be completed in ten minutes or less. Conclusion: Unavailability of a single accurate reliable self-report questionnaire that can screen for six common sleep disorders likely contributes to the under-detection of sleep disorders in primary care settings.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: Various instruments are used to assess both individual and multiple cancer symptoms. We evaluated the psychometric properties of cancer multisymptom assessment instruments. METHODS: An Ovid MEDLINE search was done. All searches were limited to adults and in English. All instruments published from 2005 to 2014 (and with at least one validity test) were included. We excluded those who only reported content validity. Instruments were categorized by the three major types of symptom measurement scales employed as follows: visual analogue (VAS), verbal rating (VRS), and numerical rating (NRS) scales. They were then examined in two areas: (1) psychometric thoroughness (number of tests) and (2) psychometric strength of evidence (validity, reliability, generalizability). We also assigned an empirical global psychometric quality score (which combined the concepts of thoroughness and strength of evidence) to rank the instruments. RESULTS: We analyzed 57 instruments (17 original, 40 modifications). They varied in types of scales used, symptom dimensions measured, and time frames evaluated. Of the 57, 10 used VAS, 28 VRS, and 19 NRS. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), ESAS-Spanish, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Symptom Distress Scale (SDS), M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-Russian, and MDASI-Taiwanese were the most comprehensively tested for validity and reliability. The ESAS, ESAS-Spanish, ASDS-2, Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS)-SF, POMS, SDS, MDASI (and some translations), and MDASI-Heart Failure all showed good validity and reliability. CONCLUSIONS: The MDASI appeared to be the best overall from a psychometric perspective. This was followed by the ESAS, ESAS-Spanish, POMS, SDS, and some MDASI translations. VRS-based instruments were most common. There was a wide range of psychometric rigor in validation. Consequently, meta-analysis was not possible.

Two independent raters reviewed the included articles using a critical appraisal scale and a structured data extraction form. RESULTS: A total of 40 studies examining 15 spasticity assessment tools in patients post-stroke were reviewed. None of the reviewed measurement tools demonstrated satisfactory results for all psychometric properties evaluated, and the majority lacked evidence concerning validity and absolute reliability. CONCLUSION: This systematic review found limited evidence to support the use of most of clinical measures of spasticity for people post-stroke.

Our aim is to systematically review the HRQoL measures specific for patients with IBD and to appraise their measurement properties and methodological quality. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases for original articles describing the development and/or evaluation of one or more of the measurement properties [e.g. internal consistency, reliability, validity, responsiveness] of HRQoL measures specific for IBD. We assessed the measurement properties and examined the methodological quality of the measurement properties of each instrument using a standardized checklist. RESULTS: We examined the full text of 75 articles that we deemed potentially eligible and identified 10 disease-specific HRQoL measures in IBD that covered different aspects of patients' lives. Internal consistency, construct validity, and content validity were the commonly evaluated measurement properties. Seven HRQoL measures scored positive for at least four of eight measurement properties. The majority of studies were rated as 'fair' to 'poor' when assessing their methodology quality. The most established HRQoL measure in the literature was the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ].

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Patient empowerment has gained considerable importance but uncertainty remains about the best way to define and measure it. The validity of empirical findings depends on the quality of measures used. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of studies assessing psychometric properties of questionnaires purporting to capture patient empowerment, evaluate the methodological quality of these studies and assess the psychometric properties of measures identified. METHODS: Electronic searches in five databases were combined with reference tracking of included articles. Peer-reviewed articles reporting psychometric testing of empowerment measures for adult patients in French, German, English, Portuguese and Spanish were included. Study characteristics, constructs operationalised and psychometric properties were extracted. The quality of study design, methods and reporting was assessed using the COSMIN checklist. The quality of psychometric properties was assessed using Terwee's 2007 criteria. FINDINGS: 30 studies on 19 measures were included. Six measures are generic, while 13 were developed for a specific condition (N=4) or specialty (N=9). Most studies tested measures in English (N=17) or Swedish (N=6). Sample sizes of included studies varied from N=35 to N=8261. A range of patient empowerment constructs was operationalised in included measures. These were classified into four domains: patient states, experiences and capacities; patient actions and behaviours; patient self-determination within the healthcare relationship and patient skills development. Quality assessment revealed several flaws in methodological study quality with COSMIN scores mainly fair or poor. The overall quality of psychometric properties of included measures was intermediate to positive. Certain psychometric properties were not tested for most measures. DISCUSSION: Findings provide a basis from which to develop consensus on a core set of patient empowerment constructs and for further work to develop a (set of) appropriately validated measure(s) to capture this.

Record.create(abstract: %q[The use of measures of suicidal ideation and behavior with sound measurement properties is critical in identifying people most at risk of suicide. In particular, brief self-report measures of suicidal ideation and behaviors are needed for use in large-scale population-based research and in the development and evaluation of suicide prevention programs in the community. This review aimed to identify and recommend psychometrically sound self-report measures of suicidal ideation and behaviors that could be used in population-based research of adults. To identify existing self-report measures for adult use, a systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) and PsycINFO (Psychological Information Database) databases. Abstracts, reference lists, and previous review papers were screened. Once measures were identified, we used a hierarchical criterion-based approach to assess their utility, psychometric properties, and appropriateness for population-based research. Nineteen measures were evaluated against 6 criteria. Three brief measures that met all criteria of the evaluation and demonstrated adequate psychometric properties were the Depressive Symptom Index Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS), Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), and Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). None of the comprehensive measures met all criteria for use in population-based studies, due to financial costs imposed on use, although the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI) and the Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (ASIQ) had considerable evidence of psychometric robustness.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in seven relevant databases, limited to peer-reviewed journals published in English, French, Spanish, Italian or German languages, between 1982 and 2012. The retained VRQoL questionnaires were described. Only relevant articles that fully meet our target population and interest criteria were eligible for psychometric properties rating. RESULTS: The literature search identified 461 potentially relevant articles, from which 69 were isolated and reviewed. Eight articles presented questionnaires that were administered to older institutionalised individuals with dementia. Three VRQoL questionnaires were identified, from which only one was designed and validated for those with mild to moderate dementia and none for individuals with more advanced dementia.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: The aims of this review were (1) to provide insight into the natural course of upper-extremity (UE) impairments and UE activity limitations associated with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD), and (2) to provide an overview of outcome measures used to evaluate UE function and activity in patients with FSHD and LGMD. METHODS: Scientific literature databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane) were searched for relevant publications. INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) studies that included persons with a diagnosis of FSHD or LGMD; and (2) studies that reported the natural course of the UE functions and/or activity with outcome measures at these levels. RESULTS: 247 publications were screened, of which 16 fulfilled the selection criteria. Most studies used manual muscle testing (MMT) to evaluate UE function and the Brooke Scale to evaluate UE mobility activities. The clinical picture of UE impairments and limitations of UE activities in FSHD and LGMD patients was highly variable. In general, FSHD and LGMD patients experience difficulty elevating their upper extremities and the execution of tasks takes considerably longer time. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of UE impairments and activity limitations associated with FSHD and LGMD is difficult to predict due to its high variability. Although measures like MMT and the Brooke Scale are often used, there is a lack of more specific outcome measures to assess UE function and UE capacity and performance in daily life. Measures such as 3D motion analysis and electromyography (EMG) recordings are recommended to provide additional insight in UE function. Questionnaires like the Abilhand are recommended to assess UE capacity and accelerometry to assess UE performance in daily life. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: There is a need for specific outcome measures on the level of UE activity. Both the level of capacity and performance should be assessed. Possible outcome measures include 3D motion analysis to assess UE function, questionnaires like the Abilhand to assess UE capacity and accelerometry to assess performance of UE activities in daily life.], accnum: %q[25098592], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: [], author: ["Bergsma, A.", "Cup, E.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: To describe walking measurement in children with spina bifida and to identify patterns in the use of walking measures in this population. DATA SOURCES: Seven medical databases-Medline, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and AMED-were searched from the earliest known record until March 11, 2014. Search terms encompassed 3 themes: (1) children; (2) spina bifida; and (3) walking. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were included if participants were children with spina bifida aged 1 to 17 years and if walking was measured. Articles were excluded if the assessment was restricted to kinematic, kinetic, or electromyographic analysis of walking. A total of 1751 abstracts were screened by 2 authors independently, and 109 articles were included in this review. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using standardized forms. Extracted data included study and participant characteristics and details about the walking measures used, including psychometric properties. Two authors evaluated the methodological quality of articles using a previously published framework that considers sampling method, study design, and psychometric properties of the measures used. DATA SYNTHESIS: Nineteen walking measures were identified. Ordinal-level rating scales (eg, Hoffer Functional Ambulation Scale) were most commonly used (57% of articles), followed by ratio-level, spatiotemporal measures, such as walking speed (18% of articles). Walking was measured for various reasons relevant to multiple health care disciplines. A machine learning analysis was used to identify patterns in the use of walking measures. The learned classifier predicted whether a spatiotemporal measure was used with 77.1% accuracy. A trend to use spatiotemporal measures in older children and those with lumbar and sacral spinal lesions was identified. Most articles were prospective studies that used samples of convenience and unblinded assessors. Few articles evaluated or considered the psychometric properties of the walking measures used.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Numerous studies concerning endometriosis and pain have been reported. However, there is no consensus on the best method to evaluate pain in endometriosis and many scales have been used. Moreover, there are only a few descriptions of minimal clinically important differences after treatment (MCID) to evaluate variations in pain. In our study, we aim to identify pain scales used in endometriosis pain treatment, to address their strong and weak points and to define which would be the ideal scale to help clinicians and researchers to evaluate endometriosis-related pain. METHODS: A search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was carried out for publications in English, French or Portuguese from 1980 to December 2012, for the words: endometriosis, treatment, pain. Studies were selected if they studied an endometriosis treatment and a pain scale was specified. A quantitative and a qualitative analysis of each scale was performed to define strong and weak points of each scale (systematic registration number: CRD42013005336). RESULTS: A total of 736 publications were identified. After excluding duplications and applying inclusion criteria 258 studies remained. We found that the visual analog scale (VAS) is the most frequently used scale. Both VAS and the numerical rating scale (NRS) show a good balance between strong and weak points in comparison with others such as the Biberoglu and Behrman scale. Concerning MCID, only VAS, NRS and Brief Pain Inventory scales have reported MCID and, among these, only VAS MCID has been studied in endometriosis patients (VAS MCID = 10 mm). Adding the Clinical Global Impression score (CGI) to the pain scale allows calculation of the MCID. CONCLUSIONS: When using pain scales their strengths and weaknesses must be known and included in the analysis. VAS is the most frequently used pain scale and, together with NRS, seems the best adapted for endometriosis pain measurement. The use of VAS or NRS for each type of typical pain related to endometriosis (dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia and non-menstrual chronic pelvic pain), combined with the CGI and a quality-of-life scale will provide both clinicians and researchers with tools to evaluate treatment response], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: [], author: ["Bourdel, Nicolas", "Alves, Joao", "Pickering, Gisele", "Ramilo, Irina", "Roman, Horace", "Canis, Michel"], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: [], endnum: %q[591], fs: [], ghp: [], id: 598, instrument: [], issn: %q[1460-2369], issue: %q[1], journal: %q[Hum.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND AND AIMS: GI endoscopy (GIE) is widely performed, with 1 in 3 people requiring an endoscopic procedure at some point. Patient experience of medical procedures is important, but, to date, experience measures of GIE are derived from clinician opinion rather than from patients themselves. In this meta-narrative review, the literature on methods of assessing patient experience in GIE is reported. METHODS: ScienceDirect, MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched to November 2013 using meta-narrative standards. Search terms included those related to endoscopic procedures, combined with those related to patient experience. RESULTS: A total of 3688 abstracts were identified and reviewed for relevance. A total of 3549 were excluded, leaving 139 for full-text review. We subsequently included 48 articles. Three sub-groups of studies were identified--those developing original measures of endoscopy-specific patient experience (27 articles), those modifying existing measures (10 articles), and those testing existing measures for reliability or validity (11 articles). Most measures focused on pain, discomfort, anxiety, and embarrassment. Three studies explored wider aspects of experience, including preparation, unit organization, and endoscopist preference. Likert scales, visual analog scale scores, and questionnaires were used most commonly. The Global Rating Scale was validated for use in 2 studies, confirming that those domains cover all aspects of endoscopy experience. Other measures were modified to assess endoscopic experience, such as the modified Group Health Association of America survey (mGHAA-9) (modified by 5 studies).

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Depression in pregnancy is a serious health issue; however, anxiety in pregnancy, with a reported higher prevalence, may also be a serious issue. Anxiety symptoms in pregnancy can relate to several anxiety types, such as general anxiety, anxiety disorders, and pregnancy-related anxiety (PrA), anxiety characterised by pregnancy specific fears and worries. Awareness of these distinctions however, is not always widespread. Both general anxiety and PrA are associated with maternal negative outcomes (e.g. increased nausea) however; PrA is more often associated with negative outcomes for the child (e.g. preterm birth). Furthermore, PrA is potentially a risk factor for postnatal depression with assessment of PrA potentially affording important intervention opportunities. Currently several different instruments are used for PrA however their psychometric properties are unclear. To our knowledge a review of current instruments and their psychometric properties is lacking, this paper aims to fill that gap. METHODS: Studies, which assessed PrA, published between 1983 and 2013 in peer-reviewed journals, were identified. RESULTS: Sixty studies were identified after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, and classified as: pregnancy-related anxiety specific, scales for other constructs, sub scales of another instrument and general anxiety scales. Each scale's strengths and limitations were discussed. LIMITATIONS: Our findings may be limited by restricting our review to peer-reviewed journals. This was done however as we sought to identify scales with good psychometric properties. CONCLUSIONS: Currently no scales are available for pregnancy-related anxiety with sound theoretical and psychometric properties. Clinically the need for such a scale is highlighted by the potential intervention opportunities this may afford.

Record.create(abstract: %q[PURPOSE: Dermatologic adverse events (dAEs) in cancer treatment are frequent with the use of targeted therapies. These dAEs have been shown to have significant impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While standardized assessment tools have been developed for physicians to assess severity of dAEs, there is a discord between objective and subjective measures. The identification of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments useful in the context of targeted cancer therapies is therefore important in both the clinical and research settings for the overall evaluation of dAEs and their impact on HRQoL. METHODS: A comprehensive, systematic literature search of published articles was conducted by two independent reviewers in order to identify PRO instruments previously utilized in patient populations with dAEs from targeted cancer therapies. The identified PRO instruments were studied to determine which HRQoL issues relevant to dAEs were addressed, as well as the process of development and validation of these instruments. RESULTS: Thirteen articles identifying six PRO instruments met the inclusion criteria. Four instruments were general dermatology (Skindex-16(c), Skindex-29(c), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and DIELH-24) and two were symptom-specific (functional assessment of cancer therapy-epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor-18 (FACT-EGFRI-18) and hand-foot syndrome 14 (HFS-14)).

Validated symptom measures are fundamental for researchers to understand women's symptom experience of PD and to test symptom interventions. The objective of this paper was to critically review the content and psychometric properties of self-report tools to measure symptoms of PD. Databases including PubMed, PsychoINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched for self-report symptom measures that had been used among women with either PD or perimenstrual symptoms. A total of 15 measures met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The measures were categorized into generic pain measures, dysmenorrhoea-specific measures, and tools designed to measure perimenstrual symptoms. These measures had varying degrees of comprehensiveness of symptoms being measured, relevance to PD, multidimensionality and psychometric soundness. No single measure was found to be optimal for use, but some dysmenorrhoea-specific measures could be recommended if revised and further tested. Key issues in symptom measurement for PD are discussed.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is common in chronic health conditions in childhood, associated with decreased quality of life and functioning, yet there are limited data to compare assessment instruments across conditions and childhood development. Our objective was to describe fatigue assessment instruments used in children with chronic health conditions and critically appraise the evidence for the measurement properties of identified instruments. METHODS: Data sources included Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycINFO (using the EBSCOhost platform). Study selection included quantitative assessment of fatigue in children with health conditions. Data extraction was as follows: (1) study design, participant and fatigue instruments, (2) measurement properties of fatigue instruments, (3) methodological quality of included studies, and (4) synthesis of the quality of evidence across studies for the measurement properties of fatigue instruments. RESULTS: Twenty fatigue assessment instruments were identified (12 child reports, 7 parent reports, 1 staff report), used in 89 studies. Fatigue was assessed in over 14 health conditions, most commonly in children with cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. Evidence for the measurement properties of instruments varied, and overall quality was low. Two fatigue instruments demonstrated strong measurement properties for use in children with diverse health conditions and children with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The review is limited to children younger than 18 years and results are specific to health conditions described, limiting generalizability of findings to other populations. Evidence for the measurement properties of fatigue instruments varied according to the population in which instruments were used and informant.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are an increasingly popular research tool used to evaluate the outcomes of surgical intervention. If applied appropriately, they can be useful both for disease monitoring and as a method of assessing the efficacy of treatment. Many disorders can lead to impingement in children and adolescents, but it is not clear if any PROs have been validated to evaluate outcomes in these populations. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We performed a systematic review of the literature to answer the following research questions: (1) Which hip-specific PROs are used in pediatric populations with impingement? (2) What clinimetric evidence exists for the use of these specific PROs in this population? METHODS: We performed two systematic searches of three databases (Medline, EMBASE, and Ovid All EBM Reviews). The first search aimed to identify specific PROs that have been applied to pediatric impingement populations. The second search aimed to find clinimetric evaluations of the PROs from the first search in this population. RESULTS: We found six hip-specific PROs applied in pediatric impingement: Harris Hip Score, modified Harris Hip Score, Iowa Hip Score, Merle d'Aubigne Hip Score, Hip Outcome Score, and Non-arthritic Hip Score. However, we found no papers validating any of these PROs in this population. Furthermore, we found no papers validating any of these PROs in any pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: A number of adult PROs have been applied in pediatric impingement disorders without evidence of validation in any pediatric population.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Clinical scales are widely used in anti-ageing research and practice. More than 100 skin ageing scales exist, which makes it difficult to choose outcome measures and to compare study results. The objectives were to assess and evaluate the quality of measurement properties of available clinical skin ageing scales. A systematic review was conducted. Electronic databases including Medline (1970 to June 2013) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2013) were searched via Ovid SP. To enhance the sensitivity forward searches were conducted in Scopus and Web of Science. We identified 111 scales in 52 included publications. Thirty studies had good methodology for at least one measurement property. Forty-two scales were evaluated for their test-retest or interrater reliability. Nineteen showed high reliability coefficients. A further 15 instruments were partly supported by content and/or structural and/or criterion validity and/or hypotheses-testing evidence. The majority of existing clinical skin ageing scales were developed for evaluating facial characteristics. Many scales quantify similar constructs. In contrast to the high number of available scales there is limited evidence supporting their measurement properties. Recommendations for the use of specific skin ageing scales for clinical studies must be made with caution because of the high number of studies with poor methodology. Development of new instruments should be justified, and existing ones investigated for scale behaviour using appropriate methods.

To investigate the inter-rater reliability of visual rating of aneurysm occlusion as study end point, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library) were searched up to June 2014. Assessment of risk for bias was based on the Quality Appraisal Tool for Studies of Diagnostic Reliability and the Guidelines for Reporting Reliability and Agreement studies. Inter-rater reliability estimates were pooled across studies using meta-analysis, and the influence of several factors (eg, imaging methods, grading scales, and occlusion rate) was tested with meta-regression. RESULTS: From 1193 titles, 644 abstracts and 87 full-text versions were reviewed. Twenty-six articles met the inclusion criteria and provided 77 reliability estimates. Twenty-one different rating scales were used, and statistical analysis varied. Mean inter-rater agreement of the pooled studies was substantial (kappa=0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.69). Reliability varied significantly as a function of imaging methods, grading scales, occlusion rates, and their interaction. Observer agreement substantially increased with increasing occlusion rate in digital subtraction angiography but not in MR angiography. Reliability was higher in studies using 2- or 3-value grading scales than in studies with 4-value grading scales. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant heterogeneity between studies evaluating the reliability of visual evaluation of aneurysm coiling.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: A variety of facial nerve grading scales have been developed over the years with the intended goals of objectively documenting facial nerve function,tracking recovery, and facilitating communication between practitioners. Numerous scales have been proposed; however, all are subject to limitation because of varying degrees of subjectivity, reliability, or longitudinal applicability. At present, such scales remain the only widely accessible modalities for facial functional assessment. The authors' objective was to ascertain which scales(s) best accomplish the goals of objective assessment. METHODS: A systematic review of the English language literature was performed to identify facial nerve grading instruments. Each system was evaluated against the following criteria: convenience of clinical use, regional scoring, static and dynamic measures, features secondary to facial palsy (e.g., synkinesis), reproducibility with low interobserver and intraobserver variability, and sensitivity to changes over time and/or following interventions. RESULTS: From 666 articles, 19 facial nerve grading scales were identified. Only the Sunnybrook Facial Grading Scale satisfied all criteria. The Facial Nerve Grading Scale 2.0 (or revised House-Brackmann Scale) fulfilled all criteria except intraobserver reliability, which has not been assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Facial nerve grading scales intend to provide objectivity and uniformity of reporting to otherwise subjective analysis. The Facial Nerve Grading Scale 2.0 requires further evaluation for intraobserver reliability. The Sunnybrook Facial Grading Scale has been robustly evaluated with respect to the criteria prescribed in this article. Although sophisticated technology-based methodologies are being developed for potential clinical application,the authors recommend widespread adoption of the Sunnybrook Facial Grading Scale as the current standard in reporting outcomes of facial nerve disorders.], accnum: %q[25357164], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: [], author: ["Fattah, A.

However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive systematic comparison of these tests has not been performed.

A systematic review identified primary manuscripts in English reporting relevant data on the following exercise tests: 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and 12-minute walk test, incremental and endurance shuttle walk tests (ISWT and ESWT, respectively), incremental and endurance cycle ergometer tests, and incremental and endurance treadmill tests.

Good repeatability (for the 6MWT and ESWT) and reproducibility (for the 6MWT, 12-minute walk test, ISWT, ESWT, and incremental cycle ergometer test) were reported by most studies assessing these tests, providing patients were familiarized with them beforehand. The 6MWT, ISWT, and particularly the ESWT were reported to be sensitive to therapeutic intervention.

Record.create(abstract: %q[BACKGROUND: To investigate the effectiveness of upper limb rehabilitation, sound measures of upper limb function, capacity, and performance are paramount. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review investigates reliability and responsiveness of upper limb measurement tools used in pediatric neurorehabilitation. METHODS: A 2-tiered search was conducted up to July 2014. The first search identified upper limb motor assessments for 1- to 18-year-old children with neuromotor disorders. The second search examined the psychometric properties of the tools. Methodological quality was rated according to COSMIN guidelines, and results for each tool were assembled in a "best evidence synthesis." Furthermore, we delineated whether tools were unimanual or bimanual tests and if they measured recovery or did not distinguish between physiological and compensatory movements. RESULTS: The first search delivered 2546 hits. Of these, 110 articles on 51 upper limb assessment tools were included. The second search resulted in 58 studies on reliability, 11 on measurement error, and 10 on responsiveness. Best evidence synthesis revealed only 2 assessments with moderate positive evidence for reliability, whereas no evidence on measurement error and responsiveness was found. The Melbourne Assessment showed moderate positive evidence for interrater and a fair positive level of evidence for intrarater reliability. The Pediatric Motor Activity Log Revised revealed moderate positive evidence for test-retest reliability.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To review the measurement properties of physical performance tests (PPTs) of the knee as each pertain to athletes, and to determine the relationship between PPTs and injury in athletes age 12 years to adult. METHODS: A search strategy was constructed by combining the terms 'lower extremity' and synonyms for 'performance test', and names of performance tests with variants of the term 'athlete'. In this, part 1, we report on findings in the knee. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed and the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist was used to critique the methodological quality of each paper. A second measure was used to analyse the quality of the measurement properties of each test. RESULTS: In the final analysis, we found 29 articles pertinent to the knee detailing 19 PPTs, of which six were compiled in a best evidence synthesis. The six tests were: one leg hop for distance (single and triple hop), 6 m timed hop, crossover hop for distance, triple jump and single leg vertical jump. The one leg hop for distance is the most often studied PPT. There is conflicting evidence regarding the validity of the hop and moderate evidence that the hop test is responsive to changes during rehabilitation. No test has established reliability or measurement error as assessed by the minimal important change or smallest detectable change. No test predicts knee injury in athletes.

Record.create(abstract: %q[INTRODUCTION: Obesity prevention strategies are needed that target multiple settings, including the worksite. The objective of this study was to assess the state of science concerning available measures of worksite environmental and policy supports for physical activity (PA) and healthy eating (HE). METHODS: We searched multiple databases for instruments used to assess worksite environments and policies. Two commonly cited instruments developed by state public health departments were also included. Studies that were published from 1991 through 2013 in peer-reviewed publications and gray literature that discussed the development or use of these instruments were analyzed. Instrument administration mode and measurement properties were documented. Items were classified by general health topic, 5 domains of general worksite strategy, and 19 subdomains of worksite strategy specific to PA or HE. Characteristics of worksite measures were described including measurement properties, length, and administration mode, as well as frequencies of items by domain and subdomain. RESULTS: Seventeen instruments met inclusion criteria (9 employee surveys, 5 manager surveys, 1 observational assessment, and 2 studies that used multiple administration modes). Fourteen instruments included reliability testing. More items were related to PA than HE. Most instruments (n = 10) lacked items in the internal social environment domain. The most common PA subdomains were exercise facilities and lockers/showers; the most common HE subdomain was healthy options/vending. CONCLUSION: This review highlights gaps in measurement of the worksite social environment.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this systematic review were 1) to identify studies that assess the psychometric performance of the English-language version of 35 generic multidimensional patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for children and young people in general populations and evaluate their quality and 2) to summarize the psychometric properties of each PROM. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched. The methodological quality of the articles was assessed using the COnsensus-based Standards for selection of health Measurement INstruments checklist. For each PROM, extracted evidence of content validity, construct validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, proxy reliability, responsiveness, and precision was judged against standardized reference criteria. RESULTS: We found no evidence for 14 PROMs. For the remaining 21 PROMs, 90 studies were identified. The methodological quality of most studies was fair. Quality was generally rated higher in more recent studies. Not reporting how missing data were handled was the most common reason for downgrading the quality. None of the 21 PROMs has had all psychometric properties evaluated; data on construct validity and internal consistency were most frequently reported. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, consistent positive findings for at least five psychometric properties were found for Child Health and Illness Profile, Healthy Pathways, KIDSCREEN, and Multi-dimensional Student Life Satisfaction Scale. None of the PROMs had been evaluated for responsiveness to detect change in general populations.

Record.create(abstract: %q[A systematic review was conducted to identify and characterize self-reported sexual function (SF) measures administered to women with a history of cancer. Using 2009 PRISMA guidelines, we searched electronic bibliographic databases for quantitative studies published January 2008-September 2014 that used a self-reported measure of SF, or a quality of life (QOL) measure that contained at least 1 item pertaining to SF. Of 1,487 articles initially identified, 171 were retained. The studies originated in 36 different countries with 23% from US-based authors. Most studies focused on women treated for breast, gynecologic, or colorectal cancer. About 70% of the articles examined SF as the primary focus; the remaining examined QOL, menopausal symptoms, or compared treatment modalities. We identified 37 measures that assessed at least one domain of SF, eight of which were dedicated SF measures developed with cancer patients. Almost one third of the studies used EORTC QLQ modules to assess SF, and another third used the Female Sexual Function Inventory. There were few commonalities among studies, though nearly all demonstrated worse SF after cancer treatment or compared to healthy controls. QOL measures are better suited to screening while dedicated SF questionnaires provide data for more in depth assessment. This systematic review will assist oncology clinicians and researchers in their selection of measures of SF and encourage integration of this quality of life domain in patient care.], accnum: %q[25997102], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: [], author: ["Jeffery, D.

Record.create(abstract: %q[Dysphagia experienced as a consequence of neurodegenerative disease can have severe consequences on a patient's health and well-being. Regular assessment of swallowing function can assist to achieve adequate nutrition and hydration. Here we review subjective swallowing assessments currently available are suitable for use in people with neurodegenerative disease. Measurement properties were reviewed for each tool and coverage of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO ICF) was considered. Assessments were identified following a review of the published literature Instruments were reviewed on the basis of reliability and validity, as well as administrative properties, such an interpretability, acceptability, and feasibility. Tools were also evaluated according to the WHO ICF framework. In total, 19 studies were identified for full-text review from 13,315 abstracts. Nine self-reported dysphagia assessment tools suitable for use in progressive neurological disorders were identified. The Swallowing Quality of Life Questionnaire (SWAL-QOL) yields the strongest combination of reliability (including internal consistency and test-retest reliability) and convergent validity while simultaneously covering all WHO ICF domains. Lengthy administration time was identified as a limitation of the SWAL-QOL. The review highlights a relative lack of well-validated self-report questionnaires in dysphagia for people with progressive neurological disease.

Record.create(abstract: %q[OBJECTIVE: To summarize the published literature on utilities for health states associated with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), including end-stage renal disease (ESRD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A literature review was conducted (MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, EMBASE, NHS EED, HEED, CEA Registry, EconLit, RePEc, and HTA) to identify relevant articles published between January 2000 and July 2013. Results were assessed for relevance by two reviewers in line with the study protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For eligible studies, data extracted included patient population, health states, methods used to elicit utility values, and the source of the preference values. RESULTS: Twelve studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. They reported various utility and/or disutility scores for different DKD health states using a range of patient populations, utility approaches, and sources of preference values. The most common study country was the USA. Most of the studies collected data at one time point, but two had a longitudinal design. Three different utility instruments - EuroQoL (EQ-5D), Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB), and 15-dimensional (15D) - were used to elicit utilities indirectly. The Time Trade-Off (TTO) approach was used in one study; another undertook a meta-analysis of published utility studies. Utilities were identified for different health states including DKD, ESRD-no dialysis, ESRD-dialysis, and transplant. One study reported utilities for patients by type of transplant. There was variation in values for the same health state between studies, and none of the studies reported utilities for the different stages of DKD. In the studies that undertook a comparison, utility values for those with DKD were generally found to be lower than those without DKD. CONCLUSIONS: This literature review highlights that at present utility scores (or disutility penalties) exist for relatively few health states in DKD. Further studies are needed to produce accurate and comprehensive utility scores that differentiate between different DKD health states.], accnum: %q[25892336], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: [], author: ["Kennedy-Martin, T.", "Paczkowski, R.", "Rayner, S."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: [], doi: %q[10.1185/03007995.2015.1041895], endnum: %q[644], fs: [], ghp: [], id: 631, instrument: [], issn: %q[1473-4877 (Electronic)], issue: %q[7], journal: %q[Curr Med Res Opin], oql: [], pnp: [], pubyear: %q[2015], ss: [], startpage: %q[1271-82], status: %q[published], title: %q[Utility values in diabetic kidney disease: a literature review], tmi: [], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25892336"])
Record.create(abstract: %q[Blunted affect, also referred to as emotional blunting, is a prominent symptom of schizophrenia. Patients with blunted affect have difficulty in expressing their emotions. The work of Abrams and Taylor and their development of the Rating Scale for Emotional Blunting in the late 1970's was an early indicator that blunted affect could indeed be assessed reliably. Since then, several new instruments assessing negative symptoms with subscales measuring blunted affect have been developed. In light of this, we aim to provide researchers and clinicians with a systematic review of the different instruments used to assess blunted affect by providing a comparison of the type, characteristics, administration and psychometric properties of these instruments. Studies reporting on the psychometric properties of instruments assessing blunted affect in patients with schizophrenia were included. Reviews and case studies were excluded. We reviewed 30 full-text articles and included 15 articles and 10 instruments in this systematic review. On average the instruments take 15-30 minutes to administer. We found that blunted affect items common across all instruments assess: gestures, facial expressions and vocal expressions. The CAINS Self-report Expression Subscale, had a low internal consistency score. This suggests that this sub-scale does not reliably assess patients' self-reported blunted affect symptoms and is likely due to the nature of blunted affect. Instruments correlated minimally with instruments measuring positive symptoms and more importantly with depression suggesting that the instruments distinguish between seemingly similar symptoms.], accnum: %q[26035179], admin_notes: %q[Converted from old COSMIN database], age: [], author: ["Kilian, S.", "Asmal, L.", "Goosen, A.", "Chiliza, B.", "Phahladira, L.", "Emsley, R."], bpv: [], cu: false, disease: [], doi: %q[10.1371/journal.pone.0127740], endnum: %q[647], fs: [], ghp: [], id: 633, instrument: [], issn: %q[1932-6203 (Electronic)], issue: %q[6], journal: %q[PLoS One], oql: [], pnp: [], pubyear: %q[2015], ss: [], startpage: %q[e0127740], status: %q[published], title: %q[Instruments measuring blunted affect in schizophrenia: a systematic review], tmi: [], url: ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26035179"])
Record.create(abstract: %q[As a long-term condition, psoriasis demands significant personal and professional input for optimal self-management. Low levels of well-being and high levels of psychological distress in patients with psoriasis are associated with reduced resources for self-care. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures can be used to assess physical, social and psychological functioning in order to guide treatment. In this article, we systematically reviewed the development and validation of existing PRO measures. PubMed (Medline), PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched systematically using predefined search terms. The search was limited to articles in the English language relating to human subjects. Articles were selected for full review through explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria. PRO measures were critically reviewed in accordance with the published guidelines and theory on the development and validation of PROs. The search identified 967 abstracts; 71 of these articles met the criteria for full review. In these 71 articles, 45 PRO measures were found: 16 were specific to psoriasis, 21 assessed other dermatological conditions and eight were developed for generic nondermatological health conditions. The review revealed several limitations of the existing measures, including: (i) a composite structure assessing multiple, poorly-defined concepts; (ii) a lack of evidence for face and content validity; (iii) a failure to include both patient and clinician perspectives and requirements and (iv) a lack of evidence regarding the feasibility and acceptability for patients and physicians. No single PRO measure with adequate evidence of validity, reliability and sensitivity to change captures patient well-being in psoriasis.
